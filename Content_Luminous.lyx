status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This version of Luminous: the Dream contains author commentary by AuroraAmissa.
 It contains extra text (typeset in pinkish boxes like this one) that explain
 how various design decisions in this fansplat came about, and help people
 who are writing roleplay systems understand the themes and subtler points
 of how Luminous is (meant to) come together.
 For Storytellers too, it will likely give quite a good deal of insight
 into how to run the game on subtle points that are hard to include in the
 main text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A lot of the D&D/Pathfinder homebrew on the Giant in the Playground forums
 once used collapsibles for a similar purpose, and seeing that helped me
 develop my own sense for game design early on.
 Mark Rosewater's blog on the design of Magic: the Gathering and its mechanics
 was similarly invaluable for that.
 This commentary is a love letter to them, of passing on the torch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Princess, to me, feels as if it became diluted over the course of its developmen
t process.
 It kept every individual piece of the original Princess: the Fading pitch
 by Cruton, but lost its core feel in the process.
 There were those who felt it was too similar to Changeling: the Dreaming,
 and tried to distinguish it.
 People had different opinions on how dark Princess should be, struggled
 and disagreed about how to tell a dark story about those who hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Its authors wasn't able to commit to a coherent theme in the way White Wolf's
 works do.
 I don't want to repeat that mistake.
 Luminous chooses a theme, rather than trying to be a little bit of something
 for everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is a story about those who are caught between reality and their dreams,
 and who see what the world could be and hence can't stand seeing the way
 it is now.
 It is a story about those who burn bright with the hope and wonder of childhood
, carrying that light into a world that had long chosen to forget it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Dream is not some Trap.
 Sensitivity is not some price to pay.
 There is no Darkness to blame for humanity's faults.
 ...
 if Luminous is like Dreaming, I choose to embrace that comparison.
 If it would be the brightest fansplat, even more so than Changeling: the
 Lost or Geist or Princess, than so be it.
 It's a story I feel is worth telling, and worth playing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In exchange, Luminous can't appeal to everyone Princess appeals to.
 That's fine.
 It'll be a better game for it.
 The same aspects of Princess I've discarded would be done more justice
 by a splat that more concretely focuses on them too.
 MushroomBadger has started his own fansplat, Beloved: the Promise doing
 exactly that, focusing less on dreams and imagination and more the struggle
 of light and dark.
 It works too, and it too is a better game for discarding what Luminous
 focuses on.

The one way to write something

 is to write for yourself, and the vision you want to convey.
 Not every possible person who could possibly want to read your works.
 You can't satisfy everyone.

Luminous: the Dream

 This book discusses subject matters such as poverty, sexism, racism, and
 all kinds of the mundane and small cruelties that are too often overlooked.
 Beyond that, its supernatural elements involve themes of irreality, blurred
 boundaries between people, and rejection of reality.

A standard content warning, really.
 Typeset in red, because stuff like this really needs to be read.
 It may not be needed for every CofD splat, but Luminous has good reason
 for one – touching on multiple themes I know some people have trouble with.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
All of us are born knowing how to dream, seeing all the wonder and beauty
 of the world.
 So many forget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Humanity always lived under the shadow of horrors, human and inhuman alike.
 To dream of a better world, to confront the shadows and beat them back
 was always too risky, always too audacious.
 Better to lay low and survive.
 To try for better means to maybe lose what you already have.
 So...
 it is, that we are taught not to dream.
 That is the nature of survival.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
...
 but someone has to try, right? You dreamed even in the darkest of nights,
 knowing that the day will break as always.
 You held your dreams close, never letting the worlds convince you to let
 them go.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Those dreams of better worlds, where humanity triumphs over the trials of
 life.
 In those dreams, you weren't alone.
 You dreamed with others who believed in the same future.
 Just maybe, it wasn't just an passing fantasy.
 Maybe there is more to this world, true meaning in that dream.
 Pushing away the little voice in the corner of your mind, that such things
 are impossible, you clung onto that hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even as the world pushed you into a corner, asked for you to yield...
 you stood.
 When everything was on the line, you refused to break, let the world turn
 you into another cog in the machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In a fleeting moment, you saw that dream again.
 But, this time, you held all its power in your own hands.
 You shaped it into a light to call your own, awakening into an endless
 waking dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With the light of two worlds, just maybe, you could really make a difference.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
Luminous: the Dream
\series default
 is a roleplaying game set in the 
\series bold
Chronicles of Darkness
\series default
, a world much like our own but caught between bleak mundanity and terrifying
 supernatural horrors.
 Night fell long ago, and the humanity still struggles against both the
 supernatural darkness that envelops it and its own faults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
...
 even in such a world, there is beauty, small lights hidden away in the
 night.
 In the depths of everyone's dreams, paths lead into a grand shared dream.
 Long ago, eight great Dream Kingdoms were imagined within, each an reflection
 of a world that could one day be real.
 A rare few chose to stay, live a second life in those worlds.
 A rarer few found a shining power in themselves, drawing on the light of
 both.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They are the Luminous.
 In a moment they call their Realization, they all once awoke a power deep
 in their soul.
 Wielding that light, they weave their dreams into reality, taking on the
 form they always imagined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their story is not a happy one.
 Every Luminous was once hurt by the world in one way or another; asked
 to stop dreaming so brightly, stop caring so much.
 For all the power they hold, the shadows of the world seem far too vast
 for any one person – magical or otherwise – to fix.
 But they still try.
 Someone has to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the Dream, they feel all the pains and joys of the world as deeply as
 their own.
 A dream so broken, hurt and scarred by all that had happened.
 Alongside the idyllic forests and shining cities, our pains and sorrows
 reflect just as clearly in humanity's Dream.
 Even there, the light is fleeting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Maybe that's okay.
 In time, even such a world can be healed, brick by brick, dream by dream
 and person by person.
 That is the task that falls to the Luminous.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous, like all Chronicles of Darkness splats is an outsider story.
 Even if they weren't touched by mysterious eldritch beings, or forced into
 a life they never wanted, they are still not people who fit in.
 They aren't the people the world is built for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Changeling: the Lost is a story about those who were hurt and traumatized,
 and rely on each other for comfort and understanding.
 The broader world doesn't even understand mundane trauma, blaming them
 for their own wounds on all the little things they can't do, all the little
 things they do that are 
\emph on
different
\emph default
.
 They never spare a thought for why.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Vampires are less of a metaphor for anything in reality, but no less an
 outsider story – literally waking only when most people sleep.
 Demons and Prometheans are those who were never human, but seek to be –
 both in their own ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Luminous aren't any less outsiders for how human they are.
 They dream too brightly for a World of Darkness, hope for too much.
 Normally voices like theirs are snuffed out by those who can't bare to
 see others fail to realize their dreams like they once did.
 Some are jealous, Some are scared, some are fearful.
 They would rather just accept those cruelties as part of life, and...
 survive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Those like the Luminous have no place in that world.
 They can't stop caring, the Dream is one that connects all things.
 They know the pain those around them feel, and 
\emph on
can't

 ignore it.
 Human, but no less outsiders.

Crossing Paths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Every person in the world has their own colorful lives to live, all woven
 together into one whole.
 Everyone relies on another, has been hurt by another, loves another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous is a game about those connections, and the chance encounters that
 create them.
 They rely on each other for hope when things are too dark for them to stand
 alone.
 Through their magic of dreams, they come to understand and rely on the
 very different people and supernatural creatures they share a world with.

Lights and Shadows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For all its flaws, the world still has its bright places, hidden among the
 shadows.
 For all its problems, the world is still beautiful.
 Little shops in the corner full of life, gardens tucked away between the
 city blocks...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It's all to think life nothing but suffering.
 It's easier to accept how the world is, if you pretend there's no point
 in trying for better.
 It's all too easy to bury your head in the sand, and pretend survival is
 living.
 But, someone who doesn't see the world as it is won't see the hidden beauty
 hidden in plain sight.
 To see the world as it is means to accept all of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
The Cost of Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To survive always comes at the cost of hope.
 Trying to make things better for yourself and those you love always risks
 what you already have.
 You can only help so many people before you don't have enough for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In holding on hope anyway, the Luminous risk all they already have.
 They fight a battle that is meant to be hopeless; so that people don't
 dare to dream.
 They fight in the name those they care about, in a world that expects people
 to keep their heads down so they aren't next in line.
 Just maybe, one day, they will turn the tides.
 That is what it means to hope.

, the central theme of Princess.
 It is still important, but this is a different way to present it that meshes
 better with all the rest of my writing.
 People don't hope, don't wish for better, because they are trying to cling
 to what they already have.
 That's the core feeling behind it all.

Media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I recommend the following works of media as possible inspiration in line

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Senki Zesshou Symphogear
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Symphogear follows the story of Hibiki, an ordinary girl who ends up bound
 to an ancient relic, allowing her to transform and fight the Noise that
 threaten the world.
 At its heart, it is a story of heartfelt communication, the determination
 to protect those you love, and the sacrifices one makes to do so.
 About the scars of the past, and what must be done to heal them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hibiki stays strong in her belief to reach to the heart throughout, fighting
 against people's despair as much she does the Noise.
 When the members of the cast suffer tragedy, it is true their bonds with
 each other that they're able to stand up again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Magia Record
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Magia Record is the spiritual successor to Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a
 dark magical girl story that helped to popularized the genre.
 For all its original is known for its darkness, though, it is still a story
 of hope and love.
 It is no wonder then, that its successor too fits well as an inspiration
 for 
\series bold
Luminous

 chronicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The anime and video game pivots the focus more to human responses to the
 woes of magic.
 It embraces the personal stories that underlie Madoka's cosmic level story,
 focusing on the relationships between magical girls and the friends that
 pull them back from the brink of despair.
 The phone game, in particular, tells the kinds of slice-of-life story Luminous
 embraces – of magical girls who care for and love each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Library of Runia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Library of Runia is a video game by Project Moon, following the story of
 librarians who staff a magical library.
 Through its powers, they learn the stories of the City they live in and
 explore the past traumas and emotional scars.
 In that sense, it is a deeply emotional story, about people, emotions,
 growth and change more than anything else.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Both the main protagonists, Angela and Roland have their own dark pasts
 and scars that are revealed through the game's progress.
 As dark as the City it portrays is, it shows the little glimmers of hope
 that lie within, and how Angela and Roland alike come to regain the hope
 that things can be better.

Luminous Nomenclature

Every CofD splat has a variety of terms for its supernatural beings, and
 Luminous is no exception.
 Main reason is it helps writing flow smoother, more than anything else.
 The main inspirations for terms in Luminous are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Luminous terms tend to be flowery (but rather plain otherwise) English or
 Italian in origin.

Dreamborn terms tend to be flowery English (implicit translation convention),
 or Irish/Irish-like.

 The sun stood proud in the sky, rising every day to beat back the dark
 night.
 So it had always been.
 Its light defined day and night, its dance across the sky defined the seasons.
 Even if just one star could not light a whole world, it still tries.
 It is much the same for those Luminous who embrace the role of Sunlit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They were often those lost in darkness alongside everyone else – trapped
 in a world full of people who didn't care and weren't allowed to care.
 They were the ones who still tried to help, even as they themselves were
 lost.
 Of course it wasn't enough; they couldn't even save themselves.
 No one person could.
 When their defiance could sustain them no longer, the Dream calls most
 to them...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they Realize their own light, they vow to be the shining beacon they
 tried to be all that time, to give a hand to those still lost in the dark,
 to stand alongside those who wish to care but cannot find the will to,
 to lead the charge against the world's shadows.
 To act, to shine as the Sun does.

Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It isn't that most people don't want to help those lost in the dark, that
 they don't want to change anything.
 Few people truly like to see others suffer.
 But...
 what they can do about it? To stand up against the world means to earn
 its ire.
 It means to be the nail that gets hammered down.
 So people don't.
 They come up with reasons why those less fortunate deserve it, hide away
 from the flaws of the world and pretend the shadows don't exist.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some try anyway.
 Some stand against the world, vowing to change it for the better.
 Some beat back the dark forces of the world by hand, without a thought
 to stealth.
 Some inspire others through their bright cheer and personalities.
 Others protect those they love, as little suns.
 All of them are driven by the same feeling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The will to stand in the center of the storm, aiming to outshine it all.
 Defiance and desperation and passion, all woven together.
 A candle that burns faster should it flickers too dim.
 A fire that announces dawn.
 Such is the dream of Sunlight.
 The will to act.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even when they have no more to give, they don't give up.
 Even if it burns themselves away in the process.
 The shadows the Sun casts are those of self-destructive desperation.
 All Weavers feel the press of Sensitivity, but for Sunlit it too easily
 warps into an all-consuming passion – driving them to unreasonable self-sacrifi
ce.

 They are the ones who stand out the most, most willing to stand in the

\end_layout

They wield their magic no differently than any would expect.
 They are direct and bright, favoring power and immediate action.

The Dream that the Luminous visit in their sleep and draw their power from
 is itself a true world, if one built out of stories and feelings rather
 than the matter and physics of the real world.
 In that world of dreams, their predecessors wove eight Kingdoms of Light
 over the years, dream-like visions of what the world could be some day
 in the future.
 Those visions shape the Invocations the Nobles use to shape their magic,
 written by like-minded Luminous over the generations and preserved in the
 depths of the Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kingdom is not quite like the Luminary or Archetype of a Luminous.
 Rather than being a part of their Dreamscape, it is rather the physical
 location their Dreamscape resides in.
 Whether its Threshold appears as a mansion in a major city or an out-of-the-way
 hollow in an unsuspecting tree, its physical presence in the Kingdom itself
 is what defines a Noble unambiguously as a member of it.

The Luminous Y-Splat.
 It's ultimately not too different from Princess' Courts, but without the

I feel Twilight Courts were one of the bigger mistakes of Princess.
 They were extreme (or otherwise tainted) versions of perfectly workable

 more comprehensive and less...

Above all else, Muirias brings together those Luminous where people value
 knowledge, without losing sight of the fundamental wonder and curiosity
 that drives people to discover.
 To them, to reduce the world to what is physically true is to rob it of
 the magic that drives that curiosity forward.
 The marvels of the world cannot be seen simply through textbooks and rote
 memorization.
 So many meaningful truths can only be learned when you experience them
 for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you understand well enough the truth behind those wonders and what
 makes them wonderful, then you can weave your own.
 When the world is known, there is no more reason to fear what is unknown.
 Thus, the only way forward is to pierce the mists of ignorance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Society's greatest achievements were always made when we learned more of
 the world around us.
 Towards that end, knowledge must be shared, not hoarded.
 People must be shown the world, not have it reduced to mathematical laws
 and cold facts.
 There is a brighter future in learning and information.
 The more minds that we can work with, the better we all will be.

A young boy wants to explore the world in all its colors.
 He wanted to see the fairies in the forest, the mermaids in the sea.
 He was told that it wasn't worth it.
 That those wonders didn't exist...
 One day, he went anyway on his own, into that park forest.
 There weren't the fairies of his fairy tales, but every time he turned
 over a new rock, he saw a new and wonderful bug he never had before.
 There weren't mermaids in the ponds, but he saw plants he never knew before

 All depending on one another, all dreaming together.
 That is the world as the Luminous know it, and it is those dreams that
 give their own power shape.

In the hidden corners of every dream, one soul blurs into another.
 The dreams of a couple weave together into a hidden grove, the dreams of

 Every fiction that has ever be written, every idea that had ever been dreamed...

The trick is to make it a difference of in-character viewpoints too.
 Luminous are those who live in the surface of the Dream (by their reckoning),
 which is still personal like the Oneiros, yet having some of the interconnected
ness of the Temenos.
 They become part of those dreams, see it as a place to live alongside Earth.
 In that way, they differ from both Mages and Beasts – that one core difference
 in thematics drives a lot of their different terminology and their different
 experience of the Dream/Astral.

The nascent Dream Kingdoms looked like the waking world, so it became like

 A town could not be empty and still be called a town, a city that does

 Even in a world governed by the laws of story and emotion, to those born
 there, the Dream was simply home.

 Their wishes too shaped the world, and crystallized into the eight Dream

 Most did not even realize there was anything special to it.
 They lived in a second life in their dreams, and that was simply how they
 were.

Other stories tell of Dreamborn who were born in the waking world too, their

 Maybe they were simply Dreamers who forgot which world they were truly

The first part of character creation is to come up with a rough idea of

 Does she consider herself a resident of the dream, or merely a visitor?
 What problems does she see in the waking world, and what does she want
 to do about them?

Aspirations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Aspirations are the main way your character earns Beats and thus advances

 They help the Storyteller know what you want to do as your character, and
 the kinds of stories you want to experience through them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous have five Aspirations; two more than usual.
 Most of them should be short-term goals that can be completed in a session
 or two, and one or two should be a longer-term goal that may take a whole
 Chapter or longer.
 The division Luminous often feel between their mundane and dream selves
 is reflected in their Aspirations.
 Of her five, two of them must relate to the waking world or her mundane
 life.
 The other two must relate to her life in the Dream or her supernatural
 life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Does she have something she wants to do with her friends in either world?
 Is there a community she is important to? What is her school life or job
 like, and is there something she wants to do there? How does she use magic
 to make the waking world a better place?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Don't be afraid of writing Aspirations that add little bits of context to
 your character, even if they are easy to fulfill.
 For example, a simple one like

Two dots in an attribute is normal human ability.
 One dots is a notable difficiency, three dots is above average, four is
 remarkable, and five is the limits of human ability.
 Anything above that is outright superhuman; beyond any mundane human's
 ability.
 Luminous may never have mundane attributes or skills over 5 dots, and cannot
 have Dream attributes over 6 dots at character creation.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You start with three Skill Specialties in your mundane skills.
 They represent your character's best skills in a given field, as opposed
 to the broader competence Skill dots represent.
 You may choose skill specialties freely, writing down whatever feels appropriat
e to your character.
 As usual, this is a chance to refine your idea of who your character is.
 A specialty for Expression (Poetry) implies someone perhaps more artistic,
 while Expression (Public Speaking) implies someone more persuasive and
 social.

 she is yet still a Luminous.

 Your character's Archetype represents the form she takes in her dreams,
 and the ideals she evokes in her appearance and style.

 similarly distant people fall under this category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Regardless of the depth of the connection, the feelings must be mutual.
 If the two participants have different feelings towards each other, the
 lower Intimacy implied is used.
 A therapist may know a lot about her patients, but this often only results
 in Weak Intimacy because they rarely truly form mutual bonds in their professio
n.
 As much as the fans of an idol may know about her, no ties of Intimacy
 are formed due to those fans blending into a faceless crowd to her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
High Intimacy provides a bonus to some Luminous ability, and low Intimacy
 inflicts a penalty on others.
 Connected Intimacy provides an Intimacy Bonus of +6 and inflicts no Intimacy
 Penalty.
 Strong Intimacy provides a bonus of +4, and inflicts a penalty of -4.
 Weak Intimacy provides a bonus of +2 and inflicts a penalty of -4.
 Weak Intimacy provides no bonus and inflicts a penalty of -8.
 Without at least Weak Intimacy, abilities that take a penalty from low
 Intimacy automatically fail.

Ultimately inspired by the P:tH Dream version of the mechanic, which was
 used as an alternative to Sympathy (as used in Vocation version).
 Intimacy is far more core to Luminous' mechanics than in Princess to push
 the theme of relationships and connections harder.
 After all, it's one of the core themes of a lot of magical girl works;
 why shouldn't it be one for this game?

 Even if the waking world asks the Luminous to harden their heart, to grow
 up, to stop caring...
 they can't.
 The deep emotion and stories of the Dream are so deeply woven into their
 being.
 No matter how long they live, they experience the triumphs and struggles
 of their life with all the intensity as they first felt them in childhood.
 Small cruelties deeply wound them as much as quiet beauty and small joys
 give them the energy to move forward regardless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hope represents that drive, the emotional strength that Luminous draw on.
 When they are full of light and confidence, Hope fuels their magic and
 pushes them forward.
 When their Hope is depleted, they are emotionally drained and have more
 and more difficulty holding onto the dreams that power their magic.

Hope is, certainly the heart of Luminous' mechanics, serving as both an
 Integrity mechanic and their Supernatural Fuel.
 Most of their splat mechanics deal with it in one way or another.
 Why shouldn't it.
 It's a 
\emph on
magical girl
\emph default
 splat.
 They were always stories about hope and friendship triumphing over the
 dark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As more of a genre consideration than anything else, Hope is a Clarity-like
 damage track rather than a representation of longer-term mental stability
 like Integrity.
 In a sense, Princess already works like this – it simply considers Shadows
 and Belief separate.
 Hope is a simplification over those two mechanics, pinning it all down
 into one thing.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Hope Track and Damage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous have a Hope track equal to their transformed Power + Resistance
 that behaves similarly to a health track.
 When an ability refers to a character's Hope, it means the number of undamaged
 Hope boxes she possesses.
 Luminous are considered to have an Integrity equivalent equal to 5 + her
 undamaged Hope boxes (to a maximum of 10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Hope track may be marked with two different kinds of damage.
 Mild Hope damage represents simpler emotional strain from her overexerting
 her magic or simply the weight of life bearing down on her without a release.
 Severe Hope damage represents fundamentally deeper pains that linger, even
 when the situation clears up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Each time a Luminous takes Hope damage, mark it off her Hope track using
 a slash (/) for mild damage and an (X) for severe damage.
 Mark mild damage in the leftmost empty box of her Hope track, and severe
 damage in the leftmost empty box or the leftmost box that is marked with
 only mild damage.
 Whenever a Princess takes mild Hope damage when her rightmost Hope box
 is filled, she instead takes a point of severe Hope damage.
\end_layout

While Hope is similar to Clarity, it isn't being used for a splat that is
 as deeply scarred as how Changelings are.
 For interactions with other parts of the World of Darkness, their Integrity
 is relatively high even at very low help.
 Otherwise, the structure is effectively the same.

Hope Recovery
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The realities of life are harsh, and its happy moments fleeting.
 Even if they don't last, though...
 those moments still give the Hopeful strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once a day, whenever a Luminous spends a scene relaxing or doing something
 she enjoys, roll Hope as a dice pool.
 She clears a box of mild Hope damage for each success.
 If there are still consequences for failure or she is putting off important
 matters to do so, she may only restore up to one Hope damage in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once a week, in place of the usual Hope recovery, she may take a significant
 amount of time confiding in someone she is close to or otherwise shares
 her struggles.
 When she does so, she adds a bonus to her Hope recovery roll equal to her
 Intimacy bonus with that person, and may clear boxes of severe Hope damage
 in addition to mild.

A subtle mechanic that serves a lot of purposes not explicitly stated.
 Hope is a pretty mild mechanic that can quickly turn dangerous; after all,
 your recovery scales with your undamaged Hope.
 Emotional strain has a way of spiraling like that.
 When things seem so hopeless, the Luminous must rely on those who they
 are close to in order to pull themselves out of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, this is the keystone that encourages Luminous to have some kind
 of a mundane life.
 Hope recovery is slow and takes time – they thrive in situations where
 they can live a quieter life, and keep their magical work somewhat separate
 from it.
 They can't easily handle having no time to rest, when the supernatural
 follows them home.
 Thus, Dual Identity and maintaining that secrecy becomes all the more important
 for them.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Attacks against Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When something shakes a Luminous' resolve or emotional stability, she takes
 an attack against Hope.
 Attacks have a die rating and may deal mild or severe Hope damage.
 To resolve one, roll that number of dice.
 Your character takes damage equal to the number of successes of the correspondi
ng type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If she took any damage from this process and her rightmost box of Hope is
 marked with damage afterwards, she gains a Hope Condition, chosen by the
 player from the following list:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous can take Hope attacks due to her Sensitivity, or due to strong
 emotional shock or significant emotional turmoil for personal reasons.
 While effects like spending Motes can directly cause Hope damage, this
 does not count as a Hope attack and never causes Hope Conditions.

Clarity is weird.
 You roll a dice pool to check the severity of the damage, then a second
 pool based on Wyrd to see how much you actually take (if any).
 Hope attacks are far simpler, since they have no reason to scale with Reverie.

 If it were not for the Dream's power, Luminous would be normal people powerless
 to stand up against the supernatural.
 If it not were for their ties to the mundane world, they would be transient
 dreams as fleeting as any other.
 In the space in between, they can become something more.
 Reverie is a measure of how closely they can bring together those two worlds,
 and shape the world through their confluence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As it increases, Luminous are able to have higher traits in Dream Form,
 maintain more magic at one time and spend more Motes without drawing on
 their Hope.
 However...
 it doesn't come without downsides.
 As a Hopeful's power grows she slowly loses her ability to keep a balance

 Motes are the small shards of power the Luminous draw on to fuel their

 They have a Mote Pool which refills to its capacity at the beginning of

 Beyond that, Luminous must draw on their own emotional strength to fuel
 their magics.
 For every Mote a Luminous spends with an empty Mote Pool, she takes a box
 of mild Hope damage, leaving her feeling down and exhausted until she has
 time to recover.

A Luminous' supernatural fuel isn't Motes.
 It's Hope.
 Hope serves as both a Clarity-like Integrity mechanic, and a Luminous'

 However, the idea of Motes gives me to name what you pay when you use your
 magic (saying Hope directly sounds...
 wrong in its implications).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The refilling Mote Pool, then, mitigates you casting from Integrity just
 a little.
 It also serves a secondary purpose of encouraging Luminous to use small
 amounts of magic often – magical girls solving relatively trivial issues

A Luminous' Dream Form always has a default Size of 5, regardless of her
 natural size.
 They have separate Form Merits that may be used to change this.

 mechanic.
 None of the official source books make it clear what exactly Dream Forms
 use for these traits, and that's not too bad because it's not nearly as

 By the nature of their Transformation, a Luminous rarely truly has to reveal
 that...
 they are the same person under it all, the shining dreamer and the ordinary
 mortal.
 Their magic grows to reflect this, ever so subtly shifting the perceptions
 of those around her to hide that fact.
 Regardless of how similar a Luminous looks in her two forms, anyone who
 meets her in both forms has an innate impression that they are different
 people and do not recgonize the similarlity on appearances or mannerisms
 alone.
\end_layout

Though Veiling protects against first impressions, the illusion is still

Even supernatural powers are fooled by this presumption.
 Magical senses like a vampire's taste for blood or a werewolf's scent tracking

 Powers that use Intimacy or similar mechanics treat her two forms as separate

 Powers used to try and extract information about her, at best, treat her
 as two people with close ties to the same friend group.
 Even powers that read thoughts or emotions do not reveal thoughts more
 closely aligned to her Dream Form.

 It's all easy to slip somewhere in between.

When a Luminous reverts to Mundane Form after transforming, she suffers
 Flicker.
 Until she has had the time to readjust to it, the habits and instinctual
 Weaving of her Dream Form make her seem more awkward, stilted and distracted.
 She suffers a penality equal to her Reverie divided by 3 (rounded up) to
 all actions taken in her Mundane Form.
 She gains a bonus on her Transformation rolls equal to that penalty.
 Once a scene, if she fails an important task or suffers significant social
 complications due to this, she gains a Beat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If it was caused by transformation, the Flicker penality reduces by one
 every ten minutes.
 This duration increases to an hour (or a scene, whichever is shorter) if
 she has been transformed for a whole scene or longer, four hours (or two
 scenes) if she has been transformed for a day or longer, one day if she
 has been transformed for a week or longer, or one week if she has been
 transformed for a month or longer.
 If she transforms again while suffering Flicker, the duration continues
 accumulating as if she had never left her Dream Form.

While she enters Dream Form when she dreams, this does not trigger Flicker
 until her Reverie increases to 6 or above.

Flicker, then, is something that the dream themes of Luminous make possible.
 They get used to falling into their dreams, letting those winds carry them

 They get used to dreaming in the waking world.
 When they revert to their Mundane Form, it crashes back on them.
 This draws attention to the fine line they walk, gives strong roleplay
 opportunities for people to portray what this looks like in practice.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It also forces 
\emph on
most

 Luminous to be careful about when they transform, without artificial limits

 Even in their waking life, a Luminous may draw on her Resonance and the

A Luminous can draw on her relationships with others, drawing on their own
 strengths for her own.
 They are magical girls after all.
 This is the cumulation of their theme of relationships, of the ties between
 people.
 I do very much like designs like this.
 Anchors and Aspirations are not only useful as out of character traits;
 their manipulation is the best representation there is in the Storyteller
 system for representing magics that shape one's own heart.

Balance-wise, 9-again isn't...
 quite as strong as it sounds.
 As a quick rundown of the probability math behind CofD, each dice produces
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 successes on average with 10-again, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{8}$
\end_inset

 successes per die with 9-again.
 That is only an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{24}$
\end_inset

 successes per die, or in other words, the equivalent of a +1 bonus per
 8 dice.
 In general, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-again, the average number of successes rolled per die is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, it doesn't help at all when you only care if you succeed or
 fail – it only makes it easier to get a large number of successes.

Dreamer's Will|textbf
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A Luminous' soul is entwined in the Sea, partly dispersed into its flows.
 Luminous may call upon that part of themselves to resist attempts to influence
 their mind or emotions, grounding themselves in a true self out of reach
 to most magic.
 They are always aware of such attempts to influence them and may spend
 Willpower on any roll to contest such effects or elect not to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When resisting supernatural influences in this way, the Luminous rolls a
 Clash of Wills versus the power with a dice pool of Reverie + Hope.
 If the power would change how she feels about one or more people she has
 a positive relationship with, she gains the highest Intimacy bonus among
 the people affected to her roll.
 However, this same protection can be turned against them.
 Should someone she has Intimacy with support the effort, or encourge her
 to fall into it (whether of their free will or otherwise), she suffers
 a penality to both her resistance roll against the ability and her Clash
 of Wills equal to their Intimacy bonus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When resisting extraordinary (but still mundane) means of mental influence
 such as drugs or advanced technology, she simply ignores the attempt.
 If she choses to do so, she immediately suffers Flicker as if she had transform
ed.
 This is not obviously a supernatural effect, and cannot be easily distinguished
 from the resistance of a particularly strong willed mortals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This power applies against effects that outright manipulate things such
 as her emotions, thought process, memory, relationships.
 More subtle effects such as illusions, those read her mind, or communicate
 information to her (even if it is distracting or false) do not trigger
 Dreamer's Will.
 However, it does still apply against powers that indirectly manipulate
 her such as those that work through manipulation of underlying reality
 or concepts.
 This is an active act of Dreamweaving and cannot be mistaken for any level
 of mortal resistance.

I've never heard of a magical girl anime where the villain beats them by

 But they have to go through that first step.
 Dreamer's Will causes a Clash of Wills against a dice pool unusually large

 Unless their Hope is depleted already, overcoming it through sheer force
 requires exceptional power.

 Each Dream Kingdom was woven around an Ideal, a reflection of all the stories

 Luminous may buy up to 5 dots in each Ideal, reflecting their understanding

To come to that understanding, a Luminous normally has to at least partly
 agree with the Ideal themselves.
 If they agree to the basic foundations of the Ideal, they may learn up
 to three dots of an Ideal intuitively.
 A Luminous who agrees with all its beliefs in at least vague terms (or
 is a member of the Kingdom) may learn all five dots of it intuitively.
 Beyond that, they must study extensively under a teacher or else glean
 the deeper meaning behind an Ideal through their

In a dream, there isn't a difference between a dreamer's imagination and
 the world around them.
 She don't need to put one foot in front of the other or move a muscle to
 walk forward...
 just, will it to be so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Luminous call that kind of action Weaving – to act by imagination as
 in a dream.
 They blur the line between reality and dreams, and learn to Weaving their
 will into the world as naturally as they move.
 It doesn't matter if she doesn't have the coordination to leap nimbly from
 roof to roof in her mundane life, she merely has to imagine doing so.
 It doesn't matter if she's never touched a gun before in reality, she must
 simply weave together a story where she hits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transformed Luminous may use an appropriate Weaving Skill in place of a
 normal skill as part of any roll they make.
 When she does so as a part of an proactive action on her part, it becomes
 a Weaving Action.
 Weaving Skills are a separate set of eight skills, that the Luminous buys
 separately as with Dream Attributes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Acting in such a way isn't blatantly supernatural, but often still leaves
 subtle tells that not everything is right.
 Maybe she defies gravity, drifting in the air far longer than she should.
 Maybe the motion of her feet doesn't quite line up with how fast she moves.
 Any witnesses may roll Perception to notice the nonphysical nature of her
 actions.

Another of the things that defines the feel of Luminous.
 They don't interact with the world as mortals or even most supernatural
 beings do.
 To them, they move by intent as in a dream.
 Imagine moving in impossible ways and simply doing so.
 Strange body plans and unfamiliar body parts don't phase them the slightest
 – before they learn how to control them physically they can simply Weave
 their way through the adjustment period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mechanically, this serves as one of their major advantages.
 They have higher dice pools on average between Dream Attributes and Weaving
 Actions.
 In fact, this replaces the normal supernatural trait added to supernatural
 powers.
 Since this gives them larger dice pools already, it's not entirely necessary
 for the Luminous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This also is meant as a partial patch to the problem some supernatural splats
 have that...
 powers require very specific Skills, limiting builds in a strange way.
 Why does a Changeling who lives in a city with no wilderness for ages have
 a Survival skill? Especially when its entire purpose is to cast Elemental
 Weapon? Because Luminous powers always use Weaving Skills, this problem
 is far lessened.

 Certain powers, such as those with exceptionally long durations, are more
 enduring in a clash.
 Day-long effects add one die to the clash roll, week-long effects add two,

Evocations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dream is woven of the light of all of humanity.
 Memories, emotion and stories melded together into a single unimaginable
 world.
 Through their Evocations, the Luminous draw a small thread of its light
 into the waking world, overturning its laws with those of the Dream.
 For an ephemeral moment, the stories and hope they see in their dreams
 may exist in their waking life too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if they aren't truly real as the powers of other supernatural beings,
 those fleeting moments are all the Luminous need, in the end.
 The stories they layer over the waking world allow them to do impossible
 things still, even if all traces of their magic fade back into illusion
 when all is done.

Evocations, and all their direct effects upon the world are a story.
 Stories bright enough to overturn the world's law for a moment, perhaps,
 but stories nevertheless.
 When they fade, all their direct disappear as if they were never cast.
 Videos of the magic fade as if nothing happened – leaving only the barest
 traces superimposed as if pasted on top to explain truly impossible actions.
 Even wounds and apparent death caused by a Luminous' magic fades like a
 dream when all is said and done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An Evocation automatically fades at the end of the Scene in which it were
 cast, and may be ended prematurely by its caster by spending a Willpower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only a precious few of an Evocation's effects can remain when it ends.
 Memories of the event, and any mental changes created by them are not affected.
 Nor are effects wrought upon a Luminous' Dream Form or other Dreamborn
 – as they were never real in the first place.
 Otherwise, to make permanent changes, the Luminous must confirm her magic
 with mundane action – after all, those are still 
\emph on

 to the waking world, even if they were only possible because of an illusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though a Luminous couldn't simply banish toxins from the soil, she could
 collect them into a pool with her magic, then collect them in a bottle.
 She couldn't teleport the items out of a safe, but she could blow off the
 door and simply carry them off.
 And well...
 when words fail and fights break out, she may ensure her opponent stays
 dead as any mortal may.

Regalia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With their Regalia, the Luminous weave superhuman abilities and touches
 of magic into their Dream Form.
 Even when they appear to be equipment and shining arms, a Luminous' Regalia
 are not truly separate from her.
 Her sword feels like as much part her as her lace wings, and she wields
 it with an almost surreal fluidity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the are extensions of her Dream Form, Regalia do not function for anyone
 other than the Luminous who summoned them, and dissolve into motes of light
 a short moment after they leave their presence.
 Disarming Luminous is rarely useful, as they may reflexively recall any
 Regalia they have lost on their turn at no cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous may summon Regalia when she transforms into her Dream Form or as
 a reflective action at the start of each turn.
 Regalia each have a base effect, and multiple Upgrades or Variants.
 Upgrades enhance the base effect of the Regalia, and Variants replace it
 – hence, only one Variant may be used at a time.

Each Regalia costs a single Mote to summon, and a further Mote at the beginning

Effects:

 The Luminous splits her Dream Form into two bodies, dispersing her awareness
 between them.
 This is disorienting and distracting to say the least, but she can often
 remain functional enough to at least get the job done.
 One of the bodies may be her Mundane Form, but this effect is only cosmetic.
 She is treated as if she were in Dream Form, albeit still with the protection
 of Dual Identity.

Both bodies share a single bar of Dream Health, and she may choose one of

 Regalia must be summoned independently for both bodies.

Other supernatural beings and occult experts have their own name for the
 Dream, and their own views of its structure.
 In general, compared to them, the Luminous prefer simple plain language
 terms, or ones drawn from popular culture over the more formal language
 most of them employ.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Maou, Mages, and human scholars of the Astral use very technical terms for
 the Dream, making literature references to esoteric concepts.
 They see the Astral as a journey from the world below, into ever more true

 to the higher truths of the world, and to more esoteric things beyond.
 They refer to a Soulspace as a

Dream Form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Dream Form is nothing truly unique in a world of dreams.
 All visitors in the Dream (or other mental spaces) manifest a Dream Form
 rather than their physical bodies.
 The Dream Forms of mortals (and most other kinds of supernatural beings)
 have their own limitations, however, compared to those of the Luminous:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Instead of using the highest of his attributes, a mortal's Dream Attributes
 are based on his mental attributes.
 He uses Intelligence for Power, Wits for Finesse, and Resolve for Resistance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mortals suffer wound penalties to Dream Health as usual.
 Neither Luminous or mortals have any protection against physical attacks
 in the Dream, as all attacks are partly magical in a sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mortals cannot perform Weaving Actions, have no Weaving Skills, and do not
 have Dual Identity.
 As such, they add Athletics instead of Flow to their Defense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, Luminous Transformation works differently in the Dream.
 They treat their Dream Form as their default form, and must roll in order
 to transform into their Mundane Form.
 They lose none of their powers or abilities in Mundane Form, but still
 has the benefits of Dual Identity and is still affected by supernatural
 powers as if she were a mortal.

Dream Combat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dream is not quite a peaceful place.
 Conflict happens in every world, for better or worse.
 ...
 and, just like in the waking world, sometimes there is no option but to
 force your way through another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You could fight in a dream the same way you do in reality.
 You pull out a sword, slicing away at your opponent's (dream) flesh.
 But...
 a Luminous sees deeper by nature.
 After all, she is in part a native of the Dream.
 A sword is mere a symbol for imposing one's will on another.
 The wounds the sword inflicts are an unmistakable mark of your will on
 another – they cannot simply imagine it away, because they were not the
 one to imagine it in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of a sword, a Luminous could wield a cutting argument, imposing
 on her target's mind in a way that reaches beyond mundane persuasion.
 She could weave a story of an party all too loud for the introvert, forcing
 them to retreat.
 A dream weapon only has to be a reflection of one's will, and the wounds
 it inflicts any mark that cannot simply be imagined away.

Intent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In dream combat, intent doesn't simply give focus to why a fight is happening
 – it is the fundamental basis of the world itself.
 When someone resorts to force in the Dream, they initiate Dream Combat,
 and all participants must declare their Intent.
 Intent determines their win condition, and the kind of story they must
 tell to achieve it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to destroy a Goetia you don't like, you're probably limited

 If you simply want to get past a door guard unharmed, you have far more

When they Blossom, the Luminous become living dreams.
 Though those dreams never truly stop being human at their heart, they are
 still what will remain of the Luminous at the very end.
 As long as their dreams live, they do too, even when their mundane body
 withers away from time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a Hopeful dies in her Mundane Form while still able to transform, she
 may transform one last time, burning away her Mundane Form entirely in
 the process.
 She immediately refills her Motes Pool and heals all Hope damage.
 Her physical body is lost to her and she begins to Fade.
 The same may happen if she retreats into the dream and lets her mundane
 body wither away, or simply outlives her natural lifespan while transformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of how it comes to be, the Luminous begin to dissolve into the
 Dream, as the stray thoughts of humanity and foreign emotions lap at the
 edges of their mind.
 They anchor themselves against those tides by force of will, clinging tight
 to those they love, to the place they know they have in the world.
 Hope sustains them in the same way food and air does a mundane human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fading Luminous no longer regain Willpower form rest, and suffer a box of
 severe Hope damage every day.
 Should their entire Hope track be filled with severe Damage, their will
 dissipates fully into the Dream and their body dissolves into motes of
 light.

 Soul Shocked Condition for any other reason.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While they can theoretically live indefinitely, no Luminous older than a
 century and a half or so have shown themselves to the broader community.
 Some say it's because of how difficult it is for a Luminous to hang on,
 especially as their friends pass away with the passage of time.
 Before the internet and the Information Age, finding others who got it
 was always a struggle.
\end_layout

Perhaps a few group of truly elder Luminous have hidden themselves away

 A close-knit Nakama of elder Luminous may indeed be able to sustain themselves
 like that.
 But...
 if they exist, they've certainly since secluded themselves away or chosen
 to guide the world from the shadows as the Maou do.

Far too many Hopeful do not have the luxury of waiting until adulthood to
 grasp the power of the Dream.
 The cruelties of the world always start far too early.
 Especially compared with other types of supernatural beings, Luminous tend
 to Blossom very early, with all the complications and benefits it comes
 with.
 On one hand...
 becoming something else is too often effectively the end of their childhood.
 On the other hand, too often that childhood is one they would not wish
 to continue even if they had the choice.

 While such a game is fundamentally a Luminous chronicle at its heart, those
 rules are still useful to represent a characters' significant younger Mundane

 The Luminous template may be used in combination with the Innocent template.
 Create the character as a normal Luminous with the following modifications:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She has a lower number of mundane skill dots equal to the normal total for
 her age, and may not place dots in a category exceeding the normal maximum
 for her age's primary category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Her mundane skills have a cap of three dots, which increases to four dots
 at Reverie 2 and five dots at Reverie 4.
 At Reverie 4, refund all Prodigy merits under the Sanctity of Merits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She has the Study skill instead of Academics and Science.
 It counts as part of the Learn Weaving skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She may buy the Youthful merit for free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Mundane Form, the usual rules for young characters apply to her.
 For example, she suffers increased wounds penalties, is easy to beat down,
 and has a significant disadvantage versus adults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Luminous do not suffer any of the usual drawbacks of childhood in their

 While their mundane actions versus adults are still penalized, this does
 not apply to Weaving Actions or the use of magic.
\end_layout

 given enough persistence and an appropriate Dream Form.

World of Darkness: Innocents Summary 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section contains a brief summary of the important rules for child character
s found in 
\series bold
World of Darkness: Innocents
\series default
.
 Using the full source book is very much recommended as it also provides
 useful thematic guidelines and flavor context as to the rules.
 This summary, then, is meant for use as a quick reference, as a backup
 if you do not have access to 
\series bold
Innocents
\series default
, and to serve as a partial update to Chronicles of Darkness rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Virtue/Vice:
\series default
 Children use Virtue/Vice like other mortals.
 While in Innocents, they have different Anchors called Asset/Fault, these
 work identically to CofD's version of Virtue/Vice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Morality and Triggers:
\series default
 Children use Integrity like other mortals.
 As Triggers were a replacement for derangements in Innocents, they are
 superseded by breaking point conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Attributes:
\series default
 Children allocate attributes the same way as older characters.
 As their dots are compared to the average of their age, they are still
 worse than adults with the same scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skills:
\series default
 Young characters are normally capped to 3 dots in each skill.
 Furthermore, they have fewer skill points to allocate based on their age.
 7-year-old children allocate 6/5/2 skills, 8-year-olds allocate 7/4/2,
 9-year-olds allocate 7/4/2, 10-year-olds allocate 8/5/3, 11-year-olds allocate
 8/5/3, 12-year-olds allocate 9/5/3, and teenagers allocate 10/6/4.
 Children younger than 10 have 1 skill specialty, children 10 or older have
 2 skill specialties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skill List:
\series default
 Children have a Study skill representing their skill at studying and schoolwork.
 This replaces their Academics and Science skills.
 They may not have the Drive skill except in special circumstances that
 would logically allow it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Escape:
\series default
 Children are especially skilled at escaping from combat.
 As long as their opponent is not fully focused on them, a child may attempt
 to escape or hide.
 Escape requires an Dexterity + Wits vs Wits + Composure roll, and hiding
 requires a Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure roll.
 Notably, in the context of Luminous, a transformation is certainly enough
 of a distraction to invoke this rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Firearms:
\series default
 The first time in a combat a character under about the age of 12 unused
 to gunfire is shot at, must spend a point of Willpower or be Beaten Down.
 Furthermore, when such a character attempts to shoot a firearm at someone
 for the first time, she must pass a Resolve + Composure roll or she misses
 and must roll again the next time she tries.
 Luminous who have fought in Dream Form before are exempt from this penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Wound Penalties:
\series default
 Children are especially vulnerable to wound penalties compared to adults.
 Instead of the normal benchmarks, she suffers a -1 penalty to all actions
 when her fifth-to-last health box is damaged, loses 10-again when her fourth-to
-last is marked, suffers a -2 penalty when her third-to-last health box
 is damaged, cannot spend Willpower to boost rolls when her second-to-last
 is marked, and suffers a -3 penalty when her last box is damaged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Stunning:
\series default
 The Stunning rules in Innocents are superseded by Beaten Down & Surrender
 optional rule.
 That rule always applies to children, even in chronicles where it doesn't
 to adults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Adults vs Children:
\series default
 Adults gain 8-again on all rolls against children, except when they try
 to hide or escape.
 Unarmed attacks by children against adults suffer a penalty equal to their
 Stamina.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Growing Up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, childhood must end even for the most imaginative or innocent of
 people.
 Even the Luminous, who are caught in the middle of the responsibility of
 adulthood and the wonders and dreams of childhood, are burdened with everchangi
ng obligations and restrictions in their mundane life.
 While many choose to spend their younger years continuing their fight,
 others often lay low for quite a while to establish themselves further
 in adult life.
 To skip a child character to adulthood, apply the following changes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remove any merits that no longer make sense and refund them under the Sanctity
 of Merits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduce all mundane skills the character has dots in by one dot (down to
 a minimum of one dot), then give them mundane skill dots up to the normal
 adult total of 22 if they have less.
 For Luminous characters, if this would reduce one of their transformed
 skills, she gains transformed skill dots to make up the difference.
 If this would increase her transformed skills, she loses transformed skill
 dots to make up the difference if possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Grant the character 20 experiences + 1 experience for every year that has
 passed.
\end_layout

Luminous characters gain a dot of Reverie in addition.

The Luminous only wove a small part of the Dream all of humanity shares
 into their Kingdoms.
 Beyond them, the skies are dyed in so many colors, touched by so many strange
 powers.
 Long ago, a rare few Hopeful seeked to understand them, dove deeply enough
 into their mysteries, that some nameless barrier broke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond that barrier, they saw a path.
 They would reach out into the Dream again as when they first Blossomed,
 to Blossom again under the light of a different power.
 They wove something stranger, further off notions into their Soulspaces
 alongside those they always wielded, allowing their new Weave and Origin
 to infuse every aspect of their magic and being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back then, Weaves were a means of survival.
 The Luminous were vulnerable in that era before they knew how to fight
 with the Dream or how to weave a Dual Identity.
 They masqueraded as other creatures, hiding among their ranks for protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current day, the reasons the Hopeful take on Weaves are as colorful
 as the Hopeful themselves.
 Some wish to show the world that even stranger powers still can be used
 in the name of good.
 Some still wish to live among the other creatures of the night, feeling
 a kinship with they they cannot find elsewhere.
 Some live in places where the protection of Dual Identity isn't enough
 to protect them.
 Then, there are those who simply wish to, feeling some nameless rightness
 in what they would become.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter especially tend to be responsible for the strangest of phenomenon.
 Not all Luminous who take on a Weave must Blossom twice.
 Some resonate so much with a particular power that they take it on when
 they Blossom the first time.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous embrace the stranger things of the world.
 They aren't the kind of people to shy away from being strange, or accepting
 that which most people would reject.
 The Weave of Names threatens to fracture a Luminous' identity, if they
 had not already been multiple.
 The Weave of Bonds threatens to make its participants lose themselves in
 each other.
 It's no wonder then, that they would see no issue in accepting forces that
 were never quite humanity's to begin with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Unlike in Beast, in Luminous, crossover is about the bonds outcasts forge
 with each other.
 They have no overarching story for what binds them together with other

 They connect with the human side of other supernatural creatures, and such
 interpersonal bonds can break through any remaining differences in supernatural
 nature.
\end_layout

Accepting Weaves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether a Luminous takes on on a Weave when she first Blossoms, or later
 on in a second Blossoming, the effect is the same.
 She spends 3 Experiences, and chooses an Origin compatible with her Weave.
 She gains the Weave's base ability and all the Origin's effects.
 Thereafter, she is forever changed.
 Thus, no Luminous may ever take on more than one Weave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She gains ranks in the Weave for every dot of her Inner Light, and gains
 one more every time it increases.
 For each rank, she may buy a single Perk associated with her Weave.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Weaves have a pretty similar structure to Entitlements, though simplified
 into something more like a Feat tree or Exalted-style Charm tree.
 This makes them pretty good for focused concepts that define something
 core to the character (e.g.
 the Weave of Bonds and the Weave of Names), or those focus strongly on
 a single core concept (e.g.
 the Weave of Daydreams).
\end_layout

Weaves are built of a mix of the power of the Dream and foreign powers.
 In even rarer cases still, a Luminous may take on a power not of the Dream
 at all in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some other supernatural forces have such titles of their own such as a Changelin

 Luminous may find herself burdened with their arcane responsibilities.
 She gains an Origin that reflects what she accepted an power from.
 The Storyteller should adjudicate how exactly such foreign powers affect
 the Luminous – in general, it becomes something more like a Weave in structure
 while keeping its own core themes.

\begin_layout Standard
When a Luminous takes on a Weave, she accepts another force into her soul,
 embracing it as she once did the Dream.
 Such a blatant embrace of the supernatural burns away some measure of the
 mundanity she once enjoyed, and binds all of her magic with the touch of
 a foreign force.
 Abilities may affect and detect such Luminous and their powers using anything
 that can detect the powers of the Dream, Will, or their Origin.

Origins serve as a point of customization, as the same concept could often
 be achieved through multiple foreign forces – or even the Dream's own touch.
 They serve a pair of related purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First, it makes it easier for Storytellers and players to write Weaves,
 since their complexity is limited to their core features.
 Secondly, they function as an unified set of downsides, so Weaves don't

Spirit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world itself dreams too, hidden far in the World Dream beyond the Foundation.
 As the waking world reflects onto the Shadow, so too do the spirits that
 live in it reflect into the World Dream.
 Long ago, a Luminous braved the Gales to reach its heart, and learned of
 the powers the Spirits dreamed of.
 Nobody remembers why.
 Perhaps it was desperation, perhaps it was in pursuit of some nameless
 calling.
 Regardless, a memory of the journey remains in the Dream Kingdoms in this
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Hopeful draws on that memory once more, she is thrown into an dangerous
 and all too real dream reflection of the Shadow.
 She feels small in comparison to the savage and passionate creatures of
 the natural world, yet catching a glimpse of the delicate balance they
 uphold through conflict.
 Grasping for power as they all do, she takes on a Resonance to call her
 own.
 Asserting herself against the flows of the world, she craves herself a
 place in the World Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Spiritual Nature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Spirit is a savage world where each fends for themselves.
 Even if she seeks to find a better way for spirits and humans alike, she
 must also embrace a measure of it to draw on the Shadow's power.
 She finds a Resonance to call her own, drawing forth a portion of that
 Essence to weave into her own Dream Form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When your character first gains the Spirit origin, choose a physical element
 or emotion she resonates with.
 She may choose concepts as broad-ranging as fire, love, rain, light, hope,
 or winter – as long as it is something relatively common in her environment.
 In her Dream Form, she is treated as a spirit of that Resonance instead
 of a Dreamborn.
 She gains an Ban and Bane as with a spirit of Rank 3.
 This can lead to complications; powers that attempt to detect her creature
 type read her as a Claimed or Ridden of some variety in either of her forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, Luminous who claim the power of the spirits depend on their
 Resonances as they do.
 For typical elements, she begins feeling drained after a week without significa
nt exposure to her element and suffers a box of mild Hope damage daily.
 After a whole month, this increases to severe Hope damage.
 For cyclic concepts like rain or winter, this duration is usually longer
 – a Luminous will begin feeling restless in the late Summer or after a
 month of drought, but certainly not after a week.
 For particularly commonplace elements like light or water, a day or so
 may be enough to drain her.

Favor of the Shadow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Hopeful of Spirit treats any amount of her Resonance in her vicinity as
 equipment, providing her an equipment bonus of up to +5 depending on the
 amount of the element present.
 A nearby fireplace could roar to life to burn down a locked door in her
 way, the rain parts way for the ancient books she holds close to her arms
 – even as it soaks her person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her Weaving Actions manifest touches of her element, and require no perception
 roll to detect as obviously supernatural.
 In the presence of a large amount of her element, it may even attempt to
 assist her in her mundane actions.
 She may benefit from a equipment bonus up to +1 or +2, and anyone who witnesses
 her actions may make a Perception roll to notice the supernatural assistance.

Wyrd
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ancient vows and pacts older than the Gentry themselves bind the Dream and
 the world of the fae together.
 Whatever its origin, the Dreaming Roads were born before any Luminous or
 True Fae laid eyes on the world.
 Far too often, the Luminous found themselves walking those roads into a
 world more real than a dream.
 There, they first touched the power of Wyrd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Hopeful accepts the powers of the Wyrd, she dreams of a memory of
 a fae world from long ago.
 She makes an oath to a beautiful fairy queen, the voice of the world itself
 – or whatever she imagines the Wyrd's face to be.
 By the terms of that accord between the Hopeful and fae, she discards her
 usual transformation in favor of the Mask that veils all fae from mortal
 eyes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Commentary

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dreams and fae magic were always well connected, so this is probably the
 least unexpected of all the Origins.
 As long as this text is, it basically boils down to this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous with ties to Wyrd have a Mask and are locked into Dream Form.
 They are vulnerable to iron.
 Finally, the Mask veils her from being easily detected as a Luminous and
 hides the stranger traits of her Dream Form the same way it hides a Changeling'
s Kith/Seeming effects.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fae Nature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Wyrd asks the Luminous join the agreements of the fae in exchange for
 its power.
 She counts as an Avowed for all interactions related to the Wyrd, although
 she still must use the charm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Shining-Vow"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 to join the Oaths of the fae.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such, iron forevermore considers her an enemy.
 The Wyrd permeates her magic, and so it too cannot defend her against the
 touch of iron.
 Iron pierces through her Regalia that provide Armor or enhanced Defense,
 and her attempts to use her Domains on it fail.
 Cold iron furthermore acts as a bane to her.
 She suffers aggravated damage from its touch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Veiled Dream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous' Transformation is fundamentally changed by the Wyrd.
 She is locked into her Dream Form, and cannot intentionally revert to her
 Mundane Form.
 In exchange, her Dream Form is hidden under a fae Mask.
 She spends Motes instead of Glamour when interacting with the Mask.
 While she may break her Mask, this has no benefits or drawbacks for the
 Luminous beyond revealing their supernatural nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of how she looked before, her Dream Form under her Mask gains
 a fantastical, mystical feel that marks her as clearly supernatural.
 What was once a flower worn in their hair grows into a tangle of vines
 and blooms.
 A hairstyle that evoked the feel of fire instead becomes an actual smoldering
 blaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should she be forced out of Dream Form, she reverts to her Mundane Form.
 She reflexively transforms as soon as she is able to, and suffers constant
 Flicker at the maximum penalty allowed by her Reverie as long as she is
 untransformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all these troubles, her Mask veils her native powers from detection.
 Supernatural effects detect her as nothing more than a Changeling.
 Likewise, it causes mortals to explain away or miss the supernatural nature
 of her Form Merits or Weaving Actions.

Fae Mask and Mein
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The fae conceal themselves from the mundane world behind a powerful illusion
 deeply embedded into their nature.
 To all mortal senses and mundane technology, anything touched by fae magic
 looks to be ordinary.
 Mortals do not notice the smell of lilacs come from the fae's hair, but
 simply assume it perfume.
 Even the coldness of an ice elemental's skin doesn't seem remarkable when
 veiled by the fae illusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This illusion is called a fae being or object's Mask, and their true form
 is called their Mein.
 Unlike a Luminous' Mundane Form, this illusion has no effect on magical
 forces.
 The mundane senses of magical beings are fooled, but their powers are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Fae only see the Mein of their fellows.
 They must spend a Glamour to see another's mask for a few brief seconds.
 In response, another fae may spend a Glamour to reinforce her mask, hiding
 her Mein even from other fae – leaving only a few tells such as her true
 form in her her shadow.
 Alternatively, a fae may spend a Glamour to burn away her Mask for a scene,
 revealing her true form in a dazzling magical display not unlike a Princess'
 transformation.
 This increases the effectiveness of the fae's Contracts and rends open
 gateways to Faerie nearby her.

The World of Darkness is filled with all kinds of supernatural beings, all
 with their own stories and paths.
 Luminous often cross paths with them in the course of their duties and
 explorations.
 This chapter provides guidelines on Luminous crossover campaigns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Beast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous and the Begotten are at once all too similar, and all too different.
 Both are native to the Dream in their own ways, one from the bright dreams
 of humanity and the other from their deepest fears.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their fundamental natures too often put them at odds with each other, regardless
 of their will or what they want.
 A Luminous' ties to the Dream cause her to feel the emotions of the community
 and those around her as deeply as if they were her own, and yet a Beast
 must fill it with fear in order to survive, driven by their own Hunger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Few beasts can (or often want to) feed in a way that don't hurt the Luminous.
 They can rarely avoid each other forever, and their powers inevitably draw
 them together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
...
 and as much as both have powers that connect people, it rarely can truly
 overcome that incompatibility.
 Most Beasts see the Luminous as another kind of Hero, and Luminous see
 the Begotten as another kind of Distorted.
 This barrier is not insurmountable, by any means – but their relationship
 is defined by high highs and low lows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Chronicles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous and Beast share a fair number of themes, for all their conflicts.
 With work, a Chronicle focusing on Beasts and Luminous can work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Both have powers that lead them towards them encountering broad rather than
 specific supernatural problems, leading them naturally towards crossover.
 With both involved in a Chronicle, it's hard to avoid this shared theme.
 Storytellers should certainly embrace it, but not lead to a feeling that
 all is 
\emph on
known
\emph default
.
 Not all problems would be recognizable to any kind of supernatural being
 – some are Outsiders, some are just what they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Both too, have an underlying theme of family and community.
 They seek companionship in those like them, and accept their inner natures,
 drawing on them for power.
 There is a connection to be forged, and a Chronicle with the two would
 likely have a feeling of family to it – of a small group that does their
 best in a world that would like neither to exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In other words, whether they call it a Brood or Nakama, that is likely what
 a mixed group of Luminous and Beasts would amount to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their conflicts, though...
 cannot be fully avoided, even then.
 Sensitivity and Hunger will always lead the two to conflict, and it will
 always define Chronicles shared between the two.
 The Storyteller should certainly be aware of this conflict, and drive it
 in directions that benefit the overall story, inflaming it sometimes if
 needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Kinship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Kinship between the Luminous and Begotten are strained by the Luminous'
 strong ties to the mundane.
 Luminous have only partial Kinship with Beasts in Dream Form, and none
 in Mundane Form.
 Thicker Than Water has no effect on Luminous in either form.
 Family Dinner, likewise, often does not apply – Hope recovery alone never
 counts, although Luminous are often still driven to hunt in ways that can
 satisfy its conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Flex Commentary

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Nightmares
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Most Luminous dream of a world that isn't afraid to step into a bright future,
 fighting against the force of fear itself.
 As such, Nightmares based on them are rarely so much based on their dreams
 or ideals, but rather the powers they use towards that goal.
 Common examples include ones that break down a target's grasp on reality,
 or drowning them in their own imagination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Power of Dreams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While Beasts are also natives of the Dream, Evocations do not have permanent
 effect on them as they do with Luminous as they are still more flesh than
 dream.
 Lairs, and their Horror, however, are vulnerable to the full force of a
 Luminous' Evocations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Luminous draw on the Dream's fundamental power to connect people and
 concepts through their Journeys and Intimacy, and Beasts through their
 Kinship and Burrows.
 Burrows can be drawn between a Luminous' Soulspace and a Chamber in the
 same way as Brood Layers.
 Luminous may forge and redefine such connections, taking a point of severe
 Hope Damage in place of spending Satiety.
 When redefining or resisting unwanted connections, she may add Hope as
 a bonus to her Clash of Wills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Changeling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Lost were once hurt in Arcadia, and...
 the Luminous on Earth.
 Both know of wonders far beyond the mundane world, and learned the power
 to wield them for themselves.
 Both are lost in a world they do not fully fit into.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For their far different backgrounds, something of their hearts are resonant.
 Both...
 understand.
 They find comfort in community, support each other, want to build something
 better to protect each other and those they love.
 Through that shared resonance, they bond with an ease unusual among differing
 kinds of supernatural being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Still, their differing supernatural natures can still be problematic, especially
 when it comes to first reactions.
 Luminous reach for a power that erodes the boundary between dreams and
 reality, in a way all too familiar to the Lost.
 Luminous magic reminds of Arcadia, and that...
 can be a painful remainder at best, and actively damaging to a changeling's
 grasp on reality at worst.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Changelings and Luminous both touch on dreams and stories, if from opposite

 Both seek comfort in their friends and support systems.
 Those similarities lead to a few interactions between their powers and
 worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Clarity and Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Clarity and Hope are very similar mechanics, both serving as a health-like
 track that replaces Integrity.
 Supernatural powers that can effect either Hope or Clarity should apply
 to the other without modifications.
 Supernatural powers that do not involve some component of genuine interaction
 cannot heal Hope.
 A Mage spell would not have much significant effect in restoring Hope,
 but the Fortifying Presence Contract can heal Hope as easily as Clarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If one of a Changeling's Touchstones possesses Sensitivity, they may use
 Take their Hand to heal Clarity, not only Hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At the Storyteller's discretion, Changelings with the Sensitivity merit
 may suffer Clarity damage and Clarity conditions rather than Hope conditions
 alone, using the same mechanics as for Luminous.
 Roll Clarity attacks caused by Sensitivity using the rules for Hope attacks
 – the Changeling simply takes mild Clarity damage equal to the number of
 successes the attack shows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Hedge and The Dream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The magic of the Luminous is centered upon shaping their own Dreams, and
 imposing it upon reality to begin with.
 Hedgespinning comes as naturally to them as any fae creature, and they
 may simply pay Motes in place of Glamour.
 They cannot shape the Hedge as they do the Dream – while it responds to
 emotion and thought, it is still a solid world of its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Similarly, Changelings in the Dream (as the Luminous define it) may Dreamweave
 as in personal dreams.
 They lose this power in the hearts of the Dream Kingdoms or the Deep Dream.
 She may apply Dreamweaving successes make Conceptual Attacks if her actions
 could justify doing so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Oaths
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous have a Charm that allow them to join to Wyrd-bound Pacts as a full

 This has farther reaching consequences than it may seem at first glance.
 Membership in Freeholds is an Oath, and so is membership in their courts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Joining a Freehold has no particular mechanical implications, beyond justifying
 Status and similar merits.
 With Storyteller permission, Luminous may take Mantle or Court Goodwill
 in chronicles where it is appropriate.
 Mantle influences a Luminous' Dream Form, do not retain the Glamour gain
 clause, and Luminous spend Motes in place of Glamour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some powers of Mantles may need to be altered to fit Luminous.
 For the default seasonal courts: Spring •••• applies with your character's
 Dream, Spring ••••• applies to Hope rather than Clarity conditions.
 Autumn ••• applies to the Mote cost of Evocations, Autumn ••••• counts
 as an Evocation and is subject to Transience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Luminous x Demon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If there is anything the Luminous and Unchained have in common, it is that
 they are good at hiding.
 Demons live many lives, wear many faces, each seeming just as mundane as
 the others.
 Luminous hide behind their Mundane Form, only revealing their true dreams
 when they must.
 In that sense, most of the time the two hardly even know they are interacting
 with another supernatural being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When they do find out, it's usually the awkward result of one of a Demon's
 Pacts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous hold the power to connect people's hearts, and Demons hide powers
 to lie to the world itself.
 Their powers inevitably conflict, and worse yet, the two cannot simply
 avoid each other.
 Both veil themselves as mundane humans, and they cannot recognize each
 other for what they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Bonds and Lies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Demon's may lies fool the Dream itself.
 If he hides his true feelings from the one he loves, he may suppress bonds
 of Intimacy that would normally be woven.
 If he presents himself as feeling closer to someone than he does, he may
 create bonds of Intimacy he does not truly mean.
 However, to create a false bond of Intimacy like that means to put one's
 self at the mercy of a Luminous' Echo.
 Her power was not meant to be lied to, and it acts unwittingly to create
 a bond rather than reinforce one that already exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As long as a Demon fakes Strong Intimacy with a Luminous, her Echo conducts
 Social Maneuvering against the Demon with the goal to bring his true feelings
 in line with his false Intimacy.
 Every week, she rolls Power + Resonate - the Demon's Composure to attempt
 to open a door.
 Should he fake an Connected Intimacy instead, this roll gains the rote
 quality and occurs once per night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Echoes, thankfully, cannot reveal a Demon's nature to the Luminous.
 It treats a Demon's Covers as if they were protected by a Luminous' Dual
 Identity, even at Strong or Connected Intimacy.
 This does not require a roll and is not Spoofing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Weave of Bonds fundamentally destroys the separation Liar's Tongue relies
 on – it has no effect on a Demon's Partner.
 Any Demon who would willingly accept such a Weave, though, would likely
 consider this a benefit more than an downside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This was a hard one to figure out.
 Demons lie, their deceptions and the Pacts that force them are so core
 to their splat.
 Luminous have a power that connects hearts.
 Every Demon power that reflects their abilities to lie draw on the separation
 between their bodies and their minds.
 Which...
 doesn't help much when Luminous connect minds directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Still, it isn't any good if Demons are stymied from making Pacts with a

Pacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Demon Pacts do not pierce a Luminous' Dual Identity, unless the Demon is
 aware of it and specifically writes the Pact to account for her two forms.
 Thus, a Luminous could trade away her relationship with a friend in Mundane
 Form to a Demon, and still maintain that relationship in her Dream Form
 – and in fact, this is the default for Demons unaware of her nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Similarly, a Soul Pact treats her two forms separately.
 A Soul Pact with a Luminous' Mundane Form gives the Demon her entire mundane
 life as usual – however, the Luminous may live on through her Dream Form
 (with the usual effects of Fading).
 A Soul Pact with a Luminous' Dream Form consumes both her identities, annihilat
ing her entirely.
 This has the usual effects of a Demon attempting to take a supernatural
 soul as a Cover.

 I really wish I could make Hope factor into Withstand somehow, but the

Arcana and Willful Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Evocations are a projection of stories and imagination upon the world, and
 thus fall under the combined purview of the Mind, Fate and Prime Arcana.
 Active Mage Sight bound to any of the three may detect the casting of an
 Evocation – however, afterwards, the Dream's laws come into effect.
 In Mage Sight, an active Evocation feels as if the true Supernal symbols
 underlying the Fallen World are buried under those of the Evocation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While those underlying truths reassert themselves when the glamour fades,
 Awakened magic still treats all things created or modified by an Evocation
 as what they appear to be – as with all things of the Astral.
 Thus, a dreamwoven rock falls under the purview of the Matter Arcana as
 if it were fully real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Luminous' Dream Form is obviously a projection of her dreams under Mind
 Mage Sight, and other Arcana treat her as what she appears to be.
 Normally Life is required to affect her as with most living beings, but
 some Luminous may have less conventional forms that require different Arcana.
 Mages cannot force transformation or detransformation directly, and Mind
 Shield provides no protection against Evocations that do not affect the
 mind directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Luminous' Echo is best studied with Mind and Space.
 Bonds of Intimacy are usually similar to the corresponding Sympathetic
 ties.
 If needed, a Mage may add Mind 1 to Space spells to specifically view or
 manipulate Intimacy.

Motes and Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To Mages, Motes are something very similar to Willpower – simply found in
 an abnormal abundance for a normal human.
 As it is not truly a form of energy, the most Mages can do is drain a Mote
 Pool as a Mind Unraveling spell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Similarly, a Luminous' Hope is simply a measurement of their mental stability.
 To a Mage, does not feel as if a source of supernatural power at all.
 A Mage may cause mild Hope damage equal to Potency with a Mind Flaying
 spell, or severe damage with a Mind Unraveling spell.
 Healing Hope damage is far harder as magically granted emotional strength
 does not fuel a Luminous' magic.
 In mechanical terms, the most a Mage can do to help with Hope is cure Hope
 Conditions, not heal the underlying Hope damage.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transferring Motes would cause a lot of balance issues.
 They regenerate per scene, and...
 that's a subtle but powerful advantage of theirs.
 It shouldn't at all be easily shared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Giving anyone the ability to restore Hope by fiat would also break the game's
 themes.
 Luminous have to struggle versus Hope, and any powerful enough healing
 ability, in my opinion, will damage that severely.
 Changeling's Clarity recovery Contract works because it's so mild, and
 has a significant social interaction component.

Soul Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While the Luminous call their dream worlds Soulspaces, they is more a modificati
on of their Oneiros than a soul as a Mage would call it.
 They still have a true soul, which is treated as an Awakened Soul, even
 in Mundane Form.
 Dual Identity cloaks this fact, and a Mage who tries to use the spell

 on an untransformed Luminous does not learn why her spell has failed and
 her powers do not detect her soul as anything other than mundane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Furthermore, Luminous do not suffer from Soul Loss as most beings do.
 The root cause of Fading is not the lack of a physical body – but rather
 their lack of a soul as Mages would recognize it.
 Luminous suffer a variant of Fading instead of Soul Loss.
 As long her as her physical body remains alive, she may still transform
 and still has a Mundane Form.
 Should she Fade in such a state, she loses all Luminous powers and gains
 the Thrall condition [M:tAw 318].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a Luminous can more or less sustain herself indefinitely without a soul,
 it's far from unheard of for Luminous aware of this fact to offer their
 own souls to save someone from Soul Loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Maou are far less interesting in this regard.
 Their souls are treated as Awakened Souls.
 They do not innately lose their ability to use their magic when Soulless;
 however because Willpower is their core resources, they will suffer magically
 for it as well.

I don't really like how a lot of fanworks (or at least players of them)
 treat Mage' opinion of what is what as the core canonical answer.
 Luminous think of their Soulspaces as their soul, even if Mages would say
 it's actually their Oneiros.
 There's no point in bending the rest of the book for Mage's sake – I use
 the terms that are most understandable and

Luminous began as a version of Princess, before its themes diverged too

 While the two can coexist, two splats built around magical girls themes
