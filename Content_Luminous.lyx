Luminous: the Dream

 is a fanmade roleplaying game for the Chronicles of Darkness, published
 by White Wolf Publishing.
 Players take on the role of magical girls or boys who dream of a better
 future for all.
 Who found themselves wielding the power of dreams against malign magical
 forces and the mundane cruelties of the world alike.
 Because they know they can make a difference.
 And as long as they can make a difference, they couldn't forgive themselves
 if they didn't at least try.

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This version of Luminous: the Dream contains author commentary (from AuroraAmiss
a).
 This is mainly meant to help explain how various design decisions in this
 fansplat came about, and thus help people writing general CofD fansplats
 or addons for Luminous to better understand the themes and subtler points
 of the system's design.
 As a bonus, if you're a Storyteller, it'll probably give you quite a bit
 of insight into how to run the game that I can't easily write into the
 text

\begin_inset Quotes xrd

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Boxes in this color are said personal commentary, and do not exist in the
 normal copies of this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I saw a lot of the D&D/Pathfinder homebrew on the Giant in the Playground
 forums use collapsible for a similar purpose, and I found the insights
 there so valuable.
 Similarly, Mark Rosewater's own blog on the design of Magic: the Gathering
 and its mechanics were invaluable in my own personal growth as a game designer.
 The community of fan set authors that built around it was equally amazing.
 In a sense, this version of Luminous is my way to pass on that legacy to
 a different community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is...
 very much a passion project for me, born out of loving so much of Princess:
 the Hopeful, and yet seeing so much of its flaws just lurking under the
 surface.
 In many ways, it is a return to the original pitch by Cruton, before Princess
 was touched by so many other hands.
 So perhaps I should say this is a fork of Princess: the Fading, not Hopeful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In my opinion, Princess became 
\emph on
diluted
\emph default
 over its development process, its themes lost when it was touched by so
 many different people with so many different opinions.
 Some people were afraid it was too like Changeling: the Dreaming, and tried
 to distinguish it.
 Others had different ideas as to how dark Princess should be, how light
 it could be without contradicting the World of Darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous refines the themes of Princess, casting the Dream as the very heart
 of what magical girls are.
 In Luminous, magical girls are those who cannot stand the shadows of the
 world and cannot let go of the dreams they first saw in their childhood.
 For them, the Dream is a source of all their power, not simply some Trap.
 In that sense, it embraces the comparison to Changeling: the Dreaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the process, it discards many of the themes that made up the Darkness
 in Princess.
 The dark forces that eat away at the heart of humanity, the struggle against
 an seemingly overwhelming opponent — in favor of far more human 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

main
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 antagonists.
 Another homebrew author, MushroomBadger, has taken up those themes at the
 heart of their own fork of Princess – Beloved: the Promise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Both of us, in some way, came to the same conclusion independently – Something
 of Princess has to be cut for its themes to come together.
 I chose to make the Dream central, and MushroomBadger choose to cut the
 Dreamlands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Princess is an amazing game despite all its flaws, one that brought the
 possibility of World of Darkness fanworks on this scale to the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

popular consciousness
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

.
 For those who want to do better, it also serves as a lesson.
 The first of them is...
 that themes are at the heart of every Chronicles of Darkness game, not
 ideas, or mechanics.
 A great idea that contradicts the rest of your work will bring it all down,
 not add to it.
 Design is about what you cut, not what you do.

 This book discusses subject matters such as poverty, sexism, racism, and
 all kinds of the mundane and small cruelties that are too often overlooked.
 Beyond that, its supernatural elements involve themes of irreality, blurred
 boundaries between people, and rejection of reality.

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you were young.
 No matter how old we may be, all of us were once young.
 We looked at the world through truly fresh eyes, felt it as fully and intensely
 as anyone ever could.
 When we loved, it was the happiest days we had ever known.
 When we were hurt, it was the greatest tragedy we had ever felt.
 And the world shined with possibility.
 We all thought we had a way to change the world, embracing it with all
 our hearts.
 We looked to our heroes and told ourselves "I can do that too".
 It seemed that if only we were given our chance, we could make the world
 better.
 That the pains of the world we felt so strongly were something we could
 overcome...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 we believed.
 We all once believed.
 And yet, when you look at the world around you today...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, you saw a man huddling in a corner, covered in all too old rags
 when you came out of the supermarket.
 So many people passed him, looking at him sadly then turning away.
 You could see the desperation on his face.
 You couldn't bear it...
 You give him what cash you had, and a change of clothes.
 It wasn't enough.
 You knew it wasn't enough...
 Not if you were the only one helping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That night, you confided in your old friend from kindergarten.
 Who you had always relied on, who had always stood by your side back then.
 ...
 and yet, this time, she frowned.
 She asked you if you really thought that money would really change anything,
 or if he would just use it to buy beer.
 She told you she was worried about how you would live through college if
 you kept doing this.
 She told you that you should let people like that go.
 That night, you cried yourself to sleep.
 Why couldn't you just be like them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, you told your parents that you wanted to be a writer instead of
 a doctor.
 They told you that you didn't really want that.
 That you wouldn't ever be popular anyway, and you'd be starving on the
 street.
 They told you that if you threw away your life like that, they wouldn't
 help you anymore.
 They told you to stop being stuck in a dream.
 You weren't sure what else you expected...
 everywhere you went, there were so many people who had given up on hoping
 so long ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least, this time was different.
 That night, you logged into the same chat room you found a few weeks ago.
 One full of people who understand your pains.
 They got it.
 They also still believed.
 They also still dreamed.
 And they comforted you.
 Showed you a way forward.
 Reassured you in the path you chose...
 They told you that it was okay to be you.
 This time, you had less reason to cry.
 Even if you still did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, you saw a boy crying in the toy aisle, clinging tightly to a stuffed
 animal he wanted.
 But his parents wouldn't have any of that.
 Because boys weren't supposed to like things like that.
 Because boys weren't supposed to cry.
 Because that is not how the world was supposed to be.
 And so many onlookers walked by, even watched with sneers on their faces.
 You couldn't tell who they even were sneering at, the mother or you.
 It didn't matter.
 Nobody helped.
 Nobody else helped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 but you tried anyway.
 Even as they dragged him away as they called you terrible names.
 He wasn't crying as much anymore.
 ...
 maybe, just maybe.
 You showed him that he wasn't alone in the world.
 Just like your friends once did for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You never could give up, no matter how hard you tried.
 No matter how much everyone around you told you to save yourself, that
 you were naive and only hurting yourself.
 You couldn't stop caring.
 You couldn't stop believing.
 You couldn't stop trying.
 You couldn't forgive yourself if you did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that...
 is what makes you a Luminous.
 Not the shining magic you wield, but the simple fact you could never stop
 dreaming of a better world.

Luminous: the Dream
\series default
 is a game about those who dream of a better future inspired by the 
\shape italic
mahou shoujo
\shape default
 (or magical girl) genre of Japanese anime and manga.
 It is set in the Chronicles of Darkness, a world much like our own only
 touched by alien wonders and terrors alike.
 This story is not truly about those horrors.
 It is about humanity, and the one power we can truly call our own.
 Our shining will to change the world.
 A will that blossomed into a force that could only be called magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this game, you play a Luminous, one of the shining souls that wields
 the power of the Dream.
 Those like you were hidden, shining dimly through so much of history.
 ...
 but shine they did.
 Writing into the untold margins of history, they built the legacy you now
 inherent.
 When you Blossomed, you awoke to the world of dreams they hid deep beyond
 the veil of sleep.
 Drawing on that grand Dream, you found a magic you just maybe could truly
 change the world with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will not be easy.
 The world has always been an unkind place.
 Generations of darkness scar the heart of humanity.
 So many people are afraid to dream, and so focus on preserving what they
 already have.
 So many people are scared that any change to the world would crumble it
 all down, and hence fear those who dream brightly.
 Some people once dreamed, and had them broken by those who were scared
 in just the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glimmers of light shine through that long and dark night.
 We had created so many wonders over the generations, and they simply accumulate.
 Even if the scars remain, so many of the problems that once plagued humanity
 are now past.
 The internet connects the Luminous together in a way they had never been
 before.
 For the first time, people could see that nobody is truly alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So many more people saw a bright future ahead, dreaming once more.
 So many more people saw more reason to fear what was to come.
 Now, if ever...
 is the time to make a difference.

Luminous is a story about humanity, its past and its future.
 As with all Chronicles of Darkness splats, it is an outsider story.

Changelings are those who were hurt and traumatized, and rely on each other
 for comfort and understand.
 The broader world doesn't even understand people hurt like that by mundane

 They blame those who were traumatized on all the little things they can't
 do, all the little things that are

Vampires are less of a metaphor for anything in reality, but no less an
 outsider story – literally waking only when most people sleep.
 Demons and Prometheans are those who were never human, but seek to be –
 both in their own ways.
 They seek an impossible ideal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Luminous aren't much different.
 They dream too brightly for the World of Darkness, hope for too much.
 Normally voices like theirs are snuffed out, by people who care too much
 to just sit by as they watch their dreams destroy them.
 People are jealous, or fearful of those who want to change the world for

At its heart,

Luminous: the Dream
\series default
 is about the contrast between dreams and idealism vs the harshness of realities
 and the necessities of survival.
 A Luminous may dream of a better world, that they know may one day be true.
 She may defeat the monster on her own.
 Maybe even she could be elected, help guide the city council towards reform.
 She can rescue the boy she loves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But even with their shining magic, they may only do so much on their own.
 They can only win when a hundred million small victories one day add up
 into something greater.
 Even as they are closer than ever before, their dreams always seems a distant
 future, still trapped faraway behind the veil of sleep.

 The scars linger, older than humanity's earliest memories.
 We don't remember why, but the pain remains.

Through the generations, that dark legacy scarred us.
 Parents teach their children to be afraid, that dreaming too bright is
 dangerous.
 They want the best for them, and so ask them to blend in so they wouldn't

 The cruelties of the world were always too large to fight.
 Survival was the name of the game from the beginning.

 There was a time before any Luminous knew how to veil their two forms in
 a Dual Identity, as there was a time before humanity could talk to anyone

 Perhaps for the first time in history, they see a way they can win.

Symphogear follows the story of Hibiki, an ordinary girl who ends up bound

 plagued the noise with the power of song.
 At its heart, it is a story about heartfelt communication that pierces
 misunderstandings, the determination to protect those you love, and the
 sacrifices one makes to do so.
 About the scars of the past, and what must be done to heal them.
\end_layout

Even in the heart of darkness, Hibiki refuses to give up.
 She stays strong in her belief in the ability to reach to the heart, always
 fighting both physical battles and against people's own despair.

 with others that they're able to stand up again.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original anime, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, is already resonant with
 the themes of Luminous.
 For all it is praised for its dark themes, at its heart, Madoka Magica
 is a love story and a story of hope.
 Madoka Kaname shone through the shadows, to rewrite the world itself.
 More than any other character in popular media, she represents the kind
 of hope Luminous stand for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magia Record, then, pivots the focus more to the human responses to the
 woes of magic in a dark world.
 It, to some extant, embraces the story that always existed under the original's
 darkness.
 It focuses on relationships, girls pulling their friends from the brink
 of despair, and standing up for what's right.
 In the side-stories shown in the original phone game, it told the same
 kind of slice-of-life stories that Luminous embraces.
 Of magical girls caring for each other, of the bonds between them that
 let them survive in a dark world.

The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part

Whereas the first movie focused on creativity and freedom, the second discusses
 true maturity.
 It shows that growing up doesn’t mean that the things you believed in when
 younger have to be forgotten and let go of.
 It tells of how even in a darker world, hoping is not in vain.
 The movie shows the world like Luminous see it; almost everyone else loses
 their flame, their light, their hope in the world, because they believe
 it’s the only way to survive.
 But it isn't true.
 The song Everything’s Not Awesome summarizes it all fairly well.

 Their nature is as fluid and shifting as any other dream.
 Before Luminous were magical girls, they were the paladins in shining armor,
 the angels with wings of light, the witch in the forest, the village shaman.
 All dreaming of a better world, where they and those they love could simply
 live happily.

The Dream that the Luminous visit in their sleep and draw their power from
 is itself a true world, if one built out of stories and feelings rather
 than the matter and physics of the real world.
 In that world of dreams, their predecessors wove eight Kingdoms of Light
 over the years, dream-like visions of what the world could be some day
 in the future.
 Those visions shape the Invocations the Nobles use to shape their magic,
 written by like-minded Luminous over the generations and preserved in the
 depths of the Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kingdom is not quite like the Luminary or Archetype of a Luminous.
 Rather than being a part of their Dreamscape, it is rather the physical
 location their Dreamscape resides in.
 Whether its Threshold appears as a mansion in a major city or an out-of-the-way
 hollow in an unsuspecting tree, its physical presence in the Kingdom itself
 is what defines a Noble unambiguously as a member of it.

I feel Twilight Courts were one of the bigger mistakes of Princess.
 They were extreme (or otherwise tainted) versions of perfectly workable

 Most of these Kingdoms are modified from P:tH's courts, modified to be
 more comprehensive and less...

To play a Luminous in a way that works in a structured tabletop roleplay,

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step One: Character Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first part of character creation is to come up with a rough idea of
 who your character is at the heart.
 What kind of person do you want to play? What was her upbringing like,
 and who are her friends in either world? Does she consider herself a resident
 of the dream, or merely a visitor? What problems does she see in the waking
 world, and what does she want to do about them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, you can solidify her whole concept into a single coherent high
 concept, such as

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Aspirations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aspirations are the main way your character earns beats, and thus advances
 their abilities.
 Furthermore, they help the Storyteller know where you want to go with your
 character, and the kinds of stories you want to experience through them.
 Some of your Aspirations should be short term goals that can be completed
 in a session or two, and at least one should be a longer-term goal that
 may take a whole Chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hopeful have two more aspirations than usual, for a total of five.
 Two Aspirations belong to your character's Mundane Form and must relate
 to the waking world or her mundane life, the other two belong to her Dream
 Form and must relate to her life in the Dream or her supernatural life,
 and her final Aspiration may be chosen freely.
 Does she have something she wants to do with her friends in either world?
 Is there a community she is important to? What is her school life or job
 like, and is there something she wants to do there? How does she use magic
 to make the waking world a better place?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't be afraid of writing Aspirations that add little bits of context to
 your character, even if they are easy to fulfill.
 For example, a simple one like 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

Find a place to live
\begin_inset Quotes xrd

 establishes that your character doesn't currently have one and one like

Step Four: Skill Specialties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You start with three Skill Specialties in your mundane skills, and one in
 your Weaving Skills.
 They represent your character's best skills in a given field, as opposed
 to the broader competence Skill dots represent.
 You may choose skill specialties freely, writing down whatever feels appropriat
e to your character.
 As usual, this is a chance to refine your idea of who your character is.
 A specialty for Expression (Poetry) implies someone perhaps more artistic,
 while Expression (Public Speaking) implies someone more persuasive and
 social.

When she Blossoms, a Luminous grasps at the symbols of the Dream to truly
 stabilize the nascent power she would come to wield.

 It forms the basis of how she uses her magic, and decides whether she focuses
 on Regalia, Domains or Charms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read over the three Luminaries you may pick (Sunlight, Moonlight and Starlight),
 and choose the one that fits your character concept the best.
 It may well be that she could fit into multiple Luminaries.
 In that case, base your decision on what kind of power you think your character
 would be the most comfortable wielding, if their personality could go either
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Archetype 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether your character would be a shining hero, an idol whose songs change
 the world, or a shrine maiden that upholds the boundary between worlds,
 she is yet still a Luminous.
 The dreams of humanity shift with the stories they tell, and the Luminous
 often end up reflecting them as well.
 Your character's Archetype represents the form she takes in her dreams,
 and the ideals she evokes in her appearance and style.

When they Blossom, the Luminous set off on a path in the twilight between

Luminous aren't lost in a dream, not quite.

 Rather than grounding themselves to a Virtue and a Vice as most mortals
 do, they hold onto their Dream of a better world, and their Wish for who
 they want to be.
 It isn't so much they were changed so much they lost them, but simply that
 they ground themselves in the things meaningful in both worlds.

 The little things matter.
 Something must change for everyone's sake.

When a Luminous first Blossoms, she sees within her own soul a world she

 That vision is called her Dream.
 It is the one future out of endless brighter possibilities she considers

 The Dream is woven out of emotion and stories.
 There is no ignoring the emotions of others, when they are a part of the

 Luminous carry a shard of that empathy into the waking world, feeling the
 triumphs and pains of those around them as if they were their own – whether
 they would like to or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While there is nothing innately supernatural about such strong empathy,

 it's at least easier for Luminous and those like them.
 Sensitivity grants the following bonuses in social interactions:

In short, the kinds of upsides you should expect from feeling others' pain.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous live in a dark world where most people don't...

 This is the second reason for Sensitivity to be a mundane merit – a mechanical

Reflected Wounds

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous fuels her power with the strength of her emotions, and far too
 often, the weight of the world can turn it back onto her.
 She cannot help but feel an echo of the emotional pain those who are suffering
 feels, even as she does her best to help those around her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a Hopeful witnesses or learns about a situation that caused someone
 significant emotional pain, she takes a mild Hope attack with dice equal
 to her Sensitivity.
 Deliberate acts of cruelty add a dice to this attack, and particularly
 heinous acts (such as prolonged deliberate torture) may add up to three
 dice, or cause severe Hope damage instead in extreme cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afterwards, she may immediately replace a short-term aspiration with one
 to alleviate the pain, or prevent the one who caused it from doing so again.
 When she completes such an Aspiration, she gains an additional beat and
 recovers mild Hope damage equal to her Sensitivity.
 If the Aspiration was a Long-Term Aspiration, she recovers all mild Hope
 damage instead.
 Luminous may have no more than two aspirations from Sensitivity at once.

 When a Luminous first Blossoms, she becomes the dreams and wonders she

 The challenges of life and the shadows of the world around her hurt her

 But...
 she can always turn to the wonders remaining in the world.

Appropriately for a magical girl splat, Hope is the beating heart of their

 a far better representation of short-term mental stability than the slow

Hope Damage and Recovery 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events that shake a Hopeful's resolve or strain her emotions cause her to
 suffer an attack against her Hope.
 She may take two kinds of Hope damage as a result.
 Mild Hope damage represents simpler emotional strain from her overexerting
 her magic or simply the weight of life bearing down on her without a release.
 Severe Hope damage represents fundamentally deeper pains that linger, even
 when the situation clears up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time a Luminous takes Hope damage, mark it off her Hope track using
 a slash (/) for mild damage and an (X) for severe damage.
 Mark mild damage in the leftmost empty box of her Hope track, and severe
 damage in the leftmost empty box or the leftmost box that is marked with
 only mild damage.
 Whenever a Princess takes mild Hope damage when her rightmost Hope box
 is filled, she instead takes a point of severe Hope damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a day, whenever she spends time relaxing or otherwise doing something
 she enjoys without expectation or consequences for failure, roll Hope.

A subtle mechanic, and one that serves a lot of purposes.
 Hope is a pretty mild mechanic as long as you keep damage low.
 But emotional strain has a way of spiraling, and the Hope mechanic reflects
 that.
 Since the dice pool for recovering Hope is remaining Hope, you simply 
\emph on
can't

 heal any more on your own once you have no remaining undamaged boxes.
 You have to rely on the people you are close too to pull you out of such

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, this is the keystone that encourages Luminous to have some kind
 of a mundane life.
 Hope recovery is slow and takes time – they thrive in situations where
 they can live a quieter life, and keep their magical work somewhat separate
 from it.
 They can't easily handle having no time to rest, when the supernatural
 follows them home.
 Thus, Dual Identity and maintaining that secrecy becomes all the more important
 for them.

 Luminous hold a willpower and emotional strength enough to overturn the
 laws of the world, and attempts to influence their minds must overcome
 that will.
 Supernatural attempts to do so trigger a Clash of Wills versus a dice pool
 of Reverie + Hope.
 Mundane attempts beyond social influence or coercion (such as drugs or
 advanced technology) simply fail.
 The Luminous is always aware of such attempts, and may spend Willpower
 on the Clash or elect to not contest the effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This protection applies against effects that outright manipulate things
 such as her emotions, thought process, memory, relationships.
 More subtle effects such as those that change her perceptions, read her
 mind, or communicate information to her (even if it is distracting or false)
 do not trigger Defiant Will.
 It also does not work on effects cast by someone with Connected Intimacy
 with the Luminous, or who already has mental influence over such a person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Defiant Will also works against more indirect powers such as a Demon's
 reality manipulation or a Mage's Sympathy manipulation, this is far more
 obviously supernatural.
 The Luminous counteracts such with her own influence over reality – this
 is a blatantly magical act, and cannot be explained away as simply her
 being a strong-willed mortal.

There's a lot going on here; tables tend to have that.
 Luminous have some improvement or another with every dot of Reverie, as
 all supernatural splats should.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The highest possible Luminous trait cap is 15, not 10.
 This is a minor advantage that mainly serves to make up for the fact that
 their dice pools do not add +Reverie or +Invocation unlike most splats.
 Weaving Skills can be increased faster than Dream Attributes to encourage
 these huge dice pools to be more specialized than general.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous rely less on their Power Stat than most splats, since it doesn't
 limit their use of powers in any way.
 Kinda like Changeling in that regard, just they don't even have Motes/turn
 limits from it.
 If you have a Weave, Reverie often becomes critical.

Motes are the small shards of magic that Luminous draw on to fuel their
 magic.
 They don't gather it from an outside source, but rather from deep within
 their own souls.
 Luminous have a Mote Pool which refills to its capacity at the beginning
 of every scene.
 Beyond that, a Luminous may still draw on her own emotional strength to
 fuel her magic.
 For every Mote she spends with an empty Mote Pool, she takes a box of mild
 Hope damage, leaving her feeling down and exhausted until she has time
 to recover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Luminous' supernatural fuel isn't Motes.
 It's Hope.
 Hope serves as both a Clarity-like Integrity mechanic, and a Luminous'
 supernatural fuel.
 However, the idea of Motes gives me to name what you pay when you use your
 magic (saying Hope directly sounds...
 wrong in its implications).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The refilling Mote Pool, then, mitigates you casting from Integrity just
 a little.
 It also serves a secondary purpose of encouraging Luminous to use small
 amounts of magic often – magical girls solving relatively trivial issues
 with magic tends to be a common theme in any show that doesn't make a point
 about using magic responsibly.

The memories and skills of Luminous who have since faded away are not lost.
 They are scattered into the collective soul of the Dream Kingdoms, to be
 remembered by future Luminous to come.
 Luminous may push their powers far beyond what they could learn on their
 own by drawing on the collective memory of the Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Dream Kingdom has an Invocation, resonating with the stories and magics
 of all Luminous who had ever been a part of it.
 A Luminous may have up to 5 dots in each Invocation.
 They reflect a worldview as much as a source of power.
 While a Luminous may use the Invocations of Kingdoms she does not agree
 with, she does not grasp their logic or concepts intuitively and must be
 taught them by someone who already understand their principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a guideline, a Luminous who agrees at least partly with an Kingdom's
 beliefs may intuitively learn its Invocation up to three dots without a
 teacher.
 A Luminous who agrees with all its beliefs in at least vague terms (or
 is a member of the Kingdom) may learn all five dots of it intuitively.

Beyond that, the dot rating of Invocations are only used as dice pools for
 Clash of Wills in Luminous.
 Rather, they unlock upgrades to Regalia/Charms and let you do more with
 your Domains.
 Since those upgrades are free, unlike in P:tH, spending experiences on
 Invocations increases the power level of your character directly – and
 in an interesting way.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous may never learn Codes intuitively, but if they manage to find a
 teacher, they may learn them the same way they do an unfamiliar Invocation
 – and thus learn the Edicts, Aspects and Domains they provide.
 In stranger cases, they may even have Affinity for a Code.
 This requires a Luminous to be Kingdomless, and they cannot choose Codes
 for both their affinity Invocations.

 Luminous magic is roughly divided into three major categories: Regalia,
 Domains and Charms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Regalia are the most physical embodiments of a Luminous' power.
 They are radiant auras and tools she weaves into her Dream Form to enhance
 her own being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Domains are the elements and concepts that resonant with a Luminous' Invocations
 and her own Dream.
 They allow her to wield the elements as naturally as she moves her own
 body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Charms are the more specialized powers of a Luminous, spells that touch
 upon esoteric mysteries of the world – or perhaps even create some of them
 for herself.

All of these categories of abilities were just Charms in P:tH.
 The split here is to allow them to have different base mechanics, putting
 them more on equal footing.
 P:tH had a problem where most Charm and Domain style powers were...
 overly narrow and hard to use just because (IMO) they were all stuffed
 into the same framework.

Mundane society always rejected the supernatural, manipulated by so many
 actors in the shadows.
 To be openly not mundane would be a death sentence for the Hopeful.
 They, as always, adapted, and found an answer in their dreams.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous have a Mundane Form in which they are simply normal humans, and
 a Dream Form in which they draw the magic and light of the Dream into reality.
 They may roll Reverie + Hope a a reflexive action in order to transform
 into Dream Form.
 Should they fail, they receive a Hope Condition and must spend a Willpower
 to transform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transforming creates a brief but spectacular display of lights and colors
 arranged in whatever symbolism fits the Luminous.
 This is extremely obvious and attention grabbing, and will generally makes
 transforming stealthily impossible, unless she is completely hidden in
 a closet, bathroom or similar place.

 dreams and the power they can summon, they are truly mundane in the eyes
 of the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All supernatural effects treat a Luminous' Mundane Form as if she were a
 normal mortal, whether this is beneficial or harmful to her.
 She may transform reflexively to better resist such abilities if she is
 aware of them.
 Abilities that would cause a Luminous to become another type of supernatural
 being or otherwise cease to be a Luminous still always fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, she loses access to the majority of her magic.
 In Mundane Form, Luminous cannot use their Mote Pools, cannot summon Regalia,
 and may only use Domains and Charms that explicitly allow it.
 She still has Supernatural Tolerance, but loses her Supernatural Potency
 for other purposes.

Mundane Form is both a strong protection and a weakness for the Luminous.

This mechanic alone makes Luminous something between a mortal chronicle

 Transforming wantonly is dangerous for the Luminous, and sometimes their

 tricks and protections.

I've chosen to use mortal game style antagonists as Luminous' bread and

 They have their own problems – those to do with the Astral and dreams,

 With such antagonists, they can choose their approach – or perhaps have
 the situation choose it for them.

Luminous live a different life in their Dreams, taking on a form reflecting

A Dream Form is a separate body, woven out of illusion and dreamstuff rather

 It has its own health track called Dream Health, with boxes equal to the
 Luminous' Resistance + her transformed attribute cap.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dream Health is less her dream body's physical integrity, and more her will
 to not be hurt made manifest.
 Thus, Luminous are often far too resilient for their delicate appearances.
 They do not suffer wound penalties in Dream Form, and furthermore mundane
 physical attacks against them are reduced in one level of severity – from
 aggravated to lethal, or lethal to bashing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, aggravated damage against her Dream Form disrupts her mental balance
 in addition to its usual harm.
 She takes a box of mild Hope damage for every box of aggravated damage
 she receives.

Regardless of her current from, a Luminous heals all damage to her Dream
 Health whenever she would recover Willpower from sleeping.
 Furthermore, every 15 minutes out of combat, she recovers one box of bashing

 Should the rightmost box of her Dream Health be filled with lethal or aggravate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous call that kind of action Weaving – to act by imagination as
 in a dream.
 They blur the line between reality and dreams, and learn to Weaving their
 will into the world as naturally as they move.
 It doesn't matter if she doesn't have the coordination to leap nimbly from
 roof to roof in her mundane life, she merely has to imagine doing so.
 It doesn't matter if she's never touched a gun before in reality, she must
 simply weave together a story where she hits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Transformed Luminous may use an appropriate Weaving Skill in place of a
 normal skill as part of any roll they make.
 When she does so as a part of an proactive action on her part, it becomes

 separately as with Dream Attributes.

Another of the things that defines the feel of Luminous.
 They don't interact with the world as mortals or even most supernatural
 beings do.
 To them, they move by intent as in a dream.
 Imagine moving in impossible ways and simply doing so.
 Strange body plans and unfamiliar body parts don't phase them the slightest
 – before they learn how to control them physically they can simply Weave
 their way through the adjustment period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mechanically, this serves as one of their major advantages.
 They have higher dice pools on average between Dream Attributes and Weaving
 Actions.
 In fact, this replaces the normal supernatural trait added to supernatural
 powers.
 Since this gives them larger dice pools already, it's not entirely necessary
 for the Luminous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This also is meant as a partial patch to the problem some supernatural splats
 have that...
 powers require very specific Skills, limiting builds in a strange way.
 Why does a Changeling who lives in a city with no wilderness for ages have
 a Survival skill? Especially when its entire purpose is to cast Elemental
 Weapon? Because Luminous powers always use Weaving Skills, this problem
 is far lessened.

The Hopeful derive one last benefit from their transformation: Their mundane
 and dream forms appear to be two different people.
 Regardless of how similar her two forms look, others around her treat them
 as if they had entirely different appearances.
 This is not exactly an illusion, as it does not change what people see.
 Rather, it simply prevents them from recognizing the two forms as the same
 based on such.
 This protection extends to magical senses such as a Vampire's taste for
 blood, or an Uratha's ability to track others by scent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supernatural powers used to try and link her two identities are similarly
 fooled.
 Powers that use Sympathy or Intimacy treat her two forms as separate –
 a friend who only knows her in her mundane form has no Sympathy with her
 Dream Form.
 Powers that determine information about a Luminous do not directly reveal
 information that connect her two identities, treating her (at best) as
 two people with close ties to the same friend group.
 That may still break her cover in the context of a full investigation,
 of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As powerful as it is, however, a Luminous cannot rely solely on Dual Identity
 to protect herself.
 It does not prevent others from suspecting a Luminous' nature based on
 circumstantial evidence.
 She cannot simply dip into a closet only to return as a mysterious magical
 girl, and not expect others to not draw the connection eventually.
 She obviously cannot transform in front of someone, and expect Dual Identity
 to protect her even slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where she needs to intentionally prove her identity, she may spend
 a Willpower to drop this protection for the rest of a scene.
 This does not necessarily convince others that she is the same person if
 she looks radically different in her two forms, but it at least removes
 any supernatural components of her disguise.

For the Hopeful, the balance between reality and their own dreams is all

 They find it all too easy to get used to that kind of half-dreaming existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she reverts to Mundane Form after transforming or visiting the Dream
 in a lucid dream, she suffers Flicker.
 She is ever so slightly distracted by the dreams and imaginations that
 would fuel her magic if she were in Dream Form, and she takes a penalty
 equal to her Reverie divided by 3 (rounded up) to all actions taken in
 her Mundane Form.
 However, she gains a bonus on her Transformation rolls equal to the usual
 penalty.
 Once a scene, if she fails an important roll or suffers significant social
 complications due to this, she gains a Beat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flicker lasts for ten minutes if the Luminous had been transformed for less
 than a scene, one scene if she had been transformed for a whole scene or
 longer, one hour if she had been transformed for a day or longer, one day
 if she had been transformed for a week or longer, and one week if she had
 been transformed for a month or longer.
 Every time the Flicker duration elapses, the penalty lowers by one.
 If she transforms or otherwise triggers Flicker before it fully fades,
 the penalty severity resets.
 Further transformations cannot decrease the duration for Flicker to fade,
 but it can increase it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, at Reverie 6 or above, Flicker no longer requires a Luminous
 to intentionally transform.
 Mundane dreams trigger Flicker too, with a duration of one hour.

 At Reverie 10, it can no longer be reduced below -2.

 it is ultimately what drives you.

Flicker, then, is something that the dream themes of Luminous make possible.
 They get used to falling into their dreams, letting those winds carry them
 around.
 They get used to dreaming in the waking world.
 When they revert to their Mundane Form, it crashes back on them.
 This draws attention to the fine line they walk, gives strong roleplay
 opportunities for people to portray what this looks like in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It also forces 
\emph on
most

 Luminous to be careful about when they transform, without artificial limits
 like the rolls to stay transformed that Princess uses.
 Subtly though, it still allows you to play Mirrory Luminous without a specific
 mechanic that allows you to do so.

 Both modes avoid the downside, with their own complications on either end.

These bonds must be mutual and cannot be strained by formal contexts or
 ingenious premises.
 If two people have different feelings towards each other, the lower Intimacy
 implied holds.
 For example, a therapist and her patient often only have Weak Intimacy,
 despite how much of her patient's life she learns, as they only interact
 in formal contexts, and are effectively forbidden from having a relationship
 beyond a very professional one.
 Similarly, unrequited love from a stalker rarely produces more than Weak
 Intimacy unless reciprocated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, Intimacy is used as a penalty to the dice pool of abilities.
 When it is used in this way, Connected Intimacy provides no penalty, Strong
 Intimacy inflicts a -2 penalty, Medium intimacy provides a -4 penalty,
 Weak Intimacy inflicts a -8 penalty, and Described Intimacy inflicts a
 -12 penalty.
 When using such an ability, you may use the Intimacy of a person you are
 touching, at the cost of decreasing the Intimacy by one level.

Quite a few Luminous have a habit of poking their noses in places they would

 Their Echo guides the way, granting them glimmers of insight beyond what

Through their shared dreams, a Luminous gains an intuitive understanding

 when she draws on it herself through Reflected Light.

 That is only an additional

\end_inset

 successes per dice, or in other words, the equivalent of a +1 bonus per

 In general, for

The words you read and hear in a dream aren't always...
 well, words.
 If you look at them too closely, they don't make sense, they don't even
 make letters.
 But, if you take them for granted, and simply take a dream for a dream
 – they weave together into an unspoken song, conveying meaning in a way
 words can't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, Aria isn't truly a language, it's that language of dreams reflected
 through a Luminous' Echo.
 When one speaks Aria, she says words in sounds that never quite resolve
 into words, yet whose character reflects her own nature.
 One who styles herself a witch may speak in tongues, a musician may sing
 words that resolve into a piano melody rather than any voice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, anyone who hears her statement understands her fully, at a depth
 that is not possible through ordinary language.
 Aria gives anyone listening to her an automatic success on rolls to determine
 her emotional state, the true intent and context behind her words, and
 the deeper meanings of what she said.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it has no innate written form, any media that can convey sound (such

 When the effects of supernatural abilities clash in this way, it triggers
 a Clash of Wills.
\end_layout

As extensions of her Dream Form, Regalia are not truly equipment – although
 they may be used as such, and can provide equipment bonuses as if they

 Regalia do not function for anyone other than the Luminous who summoned
 them, and dissolve into motes of light a short moment after they leave

 Disarming Luminous is rarely useful, as they may reflexively recall any
 Regalia they have lost on their turn at no cost.

A Luminous may summon her Regalia when she transforms into her Dream form,
 as an instant action, or by spending a Willpower as a reflexive action.
 She unsummons any existing Regalia she may have active.
 For every point of Regalia Capacity she has, she may bind a single Invocation
 to a single Regalia.
 The same Invocation can be bound to multiple Regalia, and multiple Invocations
 can be bound to a single Regalia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She benefits from the base effect of any Regalia she has an Invocation bound
 to.
 She gains the effects of all Upgrades to a Regalia she has the proper Invocatio

Other supernatural beings and occult experts have their own name for the

Maou, Mages, and human scholars of the Astral use very technical terms for
 the Dream, making literature references to esoteric concepts.

 to the higher truths of the world, and to more esoteric things beyond.

Dream Form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Dream Form is nothing truly unique in a world of dreams.
 All visitors in the Dream (or other mental spaces) manifest a Dream Form
 rather than their physical bodies.
 The Dream Forms of mortals (and most other kinds of supernatural beings)
 have their own limitations, however, compared to those of the Luminous:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Instead of using the highest of his attributes, a mortal's Dream Attributes
 are based on his mental attributes.
 He uses Intelligence for Power, Wits for Finesse, and Resolve for Resistance.
\end_layout

Mortals suffer wound penalties to Dream Health as usual.
 Neither Luminous or mortals have any protection against physical attacks
 in the Dream, as all attacks are partly magical in a sense.

Mortals cannot perform Weaving Actions, have no Weaving Skills, and do not
 have Dual Identity.
 As such, they add Athletics instead of Flow to their Defense.

In addition, Luminous Transformation works differently in the Dream.
 They treat their Dream Form as their default form, and must roll in order
 to transform into their Mundane Form.

When they Blossom, the Luminous become living dreams.
 Though those dreams never truly stop being human at their heart, they are

 As long as their dreams live, they do too, even when their mundane body
 withers away from time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a Hopeful dies in her Mundane Form while still able to transform, she
 may transform one last time, burning away her Mundane Form entirely in
 the process.
 She immediately refills her Motes Pool and heals all Hope damage.
 Her physical body is lost to her and she begins to Fade.
 The same may happen if she retreats into the dream and lets her mundane
 body wither away, or simply outlives her natural lifespan while transformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of how it comes to be, the Luminous begin to dissolve into the
 Dream, as the stray thoughts of humanity and foreign emotions lap at the
 edges of their mind.
 They anchor themselves against those tides by force of will, clinging tight

 Hope sustains them in the same way food and air does a mundane human.

Fading Luminous no longer regain Willpower form rest, and suffer a box of

While they can theoretically live indefinitely, no Luminous older than a
 century and a half or so have shown themselves to the broader community.
 Some say it's because of how difficult it is for a Luminous to hang on,

 Before the internet and the Information Age, finding others who got it

Perhaps a few group of truly elder Luminous have hidden themselves away

 A close-knit Nakama of elder Luminous may indeed be able to sustain themselves
 like that.
 But...
 if they exist, they've certainly since secluded themselves away or chosen
 to guide the world from the shadows as the Maou do.
 Others say even that's unlikely – that such isolation would itself tear

Morality and Triggers:

 Children use Integrity like other mortals.
 As Triggers were a replacement for derangements in Innocents, they are
 superseded by breaking point conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Attributes:
\series default
 Children allocate attributes the same way as older characters.
 As their dots are compared to the average of their age, they are still
 worse than adults with the same scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skills:
\series default
 Young characters are normally capped to 3 dots in each skill.
 Furthermore, they have fewer skill points to allocate based on their age.
 7-year-old children allocate 6/5/2 skills, 8-year-olds allocate 7/4/2,
 9-year-olds allocate 7/4/2, 10-year-olds allocate 8/5/3, 11-year-olds allocate
 8/5/3, 12-year-olds allocate 9/5/3, and teenagers allocate 10/6/4.
 Children younger than 10 have 1 skill speciality, children 10 or older
 have 2 skill specialities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skill List:
\series default
 Children have a Study skill representing their skill at studying and schoolwork.
 This replaces their Academics and Science skills.
 They may not have the Drive skill except in special circumstances that
 would logically allow it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Escape:
\series default
 Children are especially skilled at escaping from combat.
 As long as their opponent is not fully focused on them, a child may attempt
 to escape or hide.
 Escape requires an Dexterity + Wits vs Wits + Composure roll, and hiding
 requires a Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure roll.
 Notably, in the context of Luminous, a transformation is certainly enough
 of a distraction to invoke this rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Firearms:
\series default
 The first time in a combat a character under about the age of 12 unused
 to gunfire is shot at, must spend a point of Willpower or be Beaten Down.

Growing Up

\begin_layout Standard
One day, childhood must end even for the most imaginative or innocent of
 people.
 Even the Luminous, who are caught in the middle of the responsibility of
 adulthood and the wonders and dreams of childhood, are burdened with everchangi
ng obligations and restrictions in their mundane life.
 While many choose to spend their younger years continuing their fight,
 others often lay low for quite a while to establish themselves further
 in adult life.
 To skip a child character to adulthood, apply the following changes:

Chapter 6: Rainbow Skies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous only wove a small part of the Dream all of humanity shares
 into their Kingdoms.
 Beyond them, the skies are dyed in so many colors, touched by so many strange
 powers.
 Long ago, a rare few Hopeful seeked to understand them, dove deeply enough
 into their mysteries, that some nameless barrier broke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond that barrier, they saw a path.
 They would reach out into the Dream again as when they first Blossomed,
 to Blossom again under the light of a different power.
 They wove something stranger, further off notions into their Soulspaces
 alongside those they always wielded, allowing their new Weave and Origin
 to infuse every aspect of their magic and being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back then, Weaves were a means of survival.
 The Luminous were vulnerable in that era before they knew how to fight
 with the Dream or how to weave a Dual Identity.
 They masqueraded as other creatures, hiding among their ranks for protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current day, the reasons the Hopeful take on Weaves are as colorful
 as the Hopeful themselves.
 Some wish to show the world that even stranger powers still can be used
 in the name of good.
 Some still wish to live among the other creatures of the night, feeling
 a kinship with they they cannot find elsewhere.
 Some live in places where the protection of Dual Identity isn't enough
 to protect them.
 Then, there are those who simply wish to, feeling some nameless rightness
 in what they would become.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter especially tend to be responsible for the strangest of phenomenon.
 Not all Luminous who take on a Weave must Blossom twice.
 Some resonate so much with a particular power that they take it on when
 they Blossom the first time.

Weaves and Origins serve as the core of Luminous crossover support, as Embassies
 do in Princess.
 They...
 do support a lot of Luminous themes, hence why they're presented as a full
 chapter, not an appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous embrace the stranger things of the world.
 They aren't the kind of people to shy away from being strange, or accepting
 that which most people would reject.
 The Weave of Names threatens to fracture a Luminous' identity, if they
 had not already been multiple.
 The Weave of Bonds threatens to make its participants lose themselves in
 each other.
 It's no wonder then, that they would see no issue in accepting forces that
 were never quite humanity's to begin with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Unlike in Beast, in Luminous, crossover is about the bonds outcasts forge
 with each other.
 They have no overarching story for what binds them together with other
 supernatural creatures, because they don't need one.
 They connect with the human side of other supernatural creatures, and such
 interpersonal bonds can break through any remaining differences in supernatural
 nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In their Origins, they embrace what being a different kind of supernatural
 creature would mean for them, abandoning even the caution that Princesses
 show in their Embassies.
 They come out changed, but no less bright for it.
 That's the point.

Accepting Weaves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether a Luminous takes on on a Weave when she first Blossoms, or later
 on in a second Blossoming, the effect is the same.
 She spends 3 Experiences, and chooses an Origin compatible with her Weave.
 She gains the Weave's base ability and all the Origin's effects.
 Thereafter, she is forever changed.
 Thus, no Luminous may ever take on more than one Weave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She gains ranks in the Weave for every dot of her Inner Light, and gains
 one more every time it increases.
 For each rank, she may buy a single Perk associated with her Weave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Commentary

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Weaves have a pretty similar structure to Entitlements, though simplified
 into something more like a Feat tree or Exalted-style Charm tree.
 This makes them pretty good for focused concepts that define something
 core to the character (e.g.
 the Weave of Bonds and the Weave of Names), or those focus strongly on
 a single core concept (e.g.
 the Weave of Daydreams).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In that sense, they function more as a second template than anything else.
 Not inappropriate, considering they are usually more about things a Luminous
 can be, than powers she wields.

 In even rarer cases still, a Luminous may take on a power not of the Dream

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some other supernatural forces have such titles of their own such as a Changelin
g's Entitlements or a Mage's Legacies – and given the right situation, a
 Luminous may find herself burdened with their arcane responsibilities.
 She gains an Origin that reflects what she accepted an power from.
 The Storyteller should adjudicate how exactly such foreign powers affect
 the Luminous – in general, it becomes something more like a Weave in structure
 while keeping its own core themes.

Origins

\begin_layout Standard
When a Luminous takes on a Weave, she accepts another force into her soul,
 embracing it as she once did the Dream.
 Such a blatant embrace of the supernatural burns away some measure of the
 mundanity she once enjoyed, and binds all of her magic with the touch of
 a foreign force.
 Abilities may affect and detect such Luminous and their powers using anything
 that can detect the powers of the Dream, Will, or their Origin.

Origins serve as a point of customization, as the same concept could often
 be achieved through multiple foreign forces – or even the Dream's own touch.
 They serve a pair of related purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First, it makes it easier for Storytellers and players to write Weaves,
 since their complexity is limited to their core features.
 Secondly, they function as an unified set of downsides, so Weaves don't

Spirit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world itself dreams too, hidden far in the World Dream beyond the Foundation.
 As the waking world reflects onto the Shadow, so too do the spirits that
 live in it reflect into the World Dream.
 Long ago, a Luminous braved the Gales to reach its heart, and learned of
 the powers the Spirits dreamed of.
 Nobody remembers why.
 Perhaps it was desperation, perhaps it was in pursuit of some nameless
 calling.
 Regardless, a memory of the journey remains in the Dream Kingdoms in this
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Hopeful draws on that memory once more, she is thrown into an dangerous
 and all too real dream reflection of the Shadow.
 She feels small in comparison to the savage and passionate creatures of
 the natural world, yet catching a glimpse of the delicate balance they
 uphold through conflict.
 Grasping for power as they all do, she takes on a Resonance to call her
 own.
 Asserting herself against the flows of the world, she craves herself a
 place in the World Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Spiritual Nature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Spirit is a savage world where each fends for themselves.
 Even if she seeks to find a better way for spirits and humans alike, she
 must also embrace a measure of it to draw on the Shadow's power.
 She finds a Resonance to call her own, drawing forth a portion of that
 Essence to weave into her own Dream Form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When your character first gains the Spirit origin, choose a physical element
 or emotion she resonates with.
 She may choose concepts as broad-ranging as fire, love, rain, light, hope,
 or winter – as long as it is something relatively common in her environment.
 In her Dream Form, she is treated as a spirit of that Resonance instead
 of a Dreamborn.
 She gains an Ban and Bane as with a spirit of Rank 3.
 This can lead to complications; powers that attempt to detect her creature
 type read her as a Claimed or Ridden of some variety in either of her forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, Luminous who claim the power of the spirits depend on their
 Resonances as they do.
 For typical elements, she begins feeling drained after a week without significa
nt exposure to her element and suffers a box of mild Hope damage daily.
 After a whole month, this increases to severe Hope damage.
 For cyclic concepts like rain or winter, this duration is usually longer
 – a Luminous will begin feeling restless in the late Summer or after a
 month of drought, but certainly not after a week.
 For particularly commonplace elements like light or water, a day or so
 may be enough to drain her.

 – even as it soaks her person.
\end_layout

Her Weaving Actions manifest touches of her element, and require no perception
 roll to detect as obviously supernatural.
 In the presence of a large amount of her element, it may even attempt to

 her actions may make a Perception roll to notice the supernatural assistance.

Ancient vows and pacts older than the Gentry themselves bind the Dream and

 Whatever its origin, the Dreaming Roads were born before any Luminous or

 Far too often, the Luminous found themselves walking those roads into a
 world more real than a dream.
 There, they first touched the power of Wyrd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Hopeful accepts the powers of the Wyrd, she dreams of a memory of
 a fae world from long ago.
 She makes an oath to a beautiful fairy queen, the voice of the world itself
 – or whatever she imagines the Wyrd's face to be.
 By the terms of that accord between the Hopeful and fae, she discards her
 usual transformation in favor of the Mask that veils all fae from mortal
 eyes.

Dreams and fae magic were always well connected, so this is probably the

 As long as this text is, it basically boils down to this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous with ties to Wyrd have a Mask and are locked into Dream Form.
 They are vulnerable to iron.
 Finally, the Mask veils her from being easily detected as a Luminous and
 hides the stranger traits of her Dream Form the same way it hides a Changeling'

 to join the Oaths of the fae.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such, iron forevermore considers her an enemy.
 The Wyrd permeates her magic, and so it too cannot defend her against the
 touch of iron.
 Iron pierces through her Regalia that provide Armor or enhanced Defense,
 and her attempts to use her Domains on it fail.
 Cold iron furthermore acts as a bane to her.
 She suffers aggravated damage from its touch.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous' Transformation is fundamentally changed by the Wyrd.
 She is locked into her Dream Form, and cannot intentionally revert to her
 Mundane Form.
 In exchange, her Dream Form is hidden under a fae Mask.
 She spends Motes instead of Glamour when interacting with the Mask.
 While she may break her Mask, this has no benefits or drawbacks for the
 Luminous beyond revealing their supernatural nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of how she looked before, her Dream Form under her Mask gains
 a fantastical, mystical feel that marks her as clearly supernatural.
 What was once a flower worn in their hair grows into a tangle of vines
 and blooms.
 A hairstyle that evoked the feel of fire instead becomes an actual smoldering
 blaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should she be forced out of Dream Form, she reverts to her Mundane Form.
 She reflexively transforms as soon as she is able to, and suffers constant

 untransformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all these troubles, her Mask veils her native powers from detection.
 Supernatural effects detect her as nothing more than a Changeling.

The fae conceal themselves from the mundane world behind a powerful illusion
 deeply embedded into their nature.
 To all mortal senses and mundane technology, anything touched by fae magic
 looks to be ordinary.
 Mortals do not notice the smell of lilacs come from the fae's hair, but
 simply assume it perfume.
 Even the coldness of an ice elemental's skin doesn't seem remarkable when
 veiled by the fae illusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This illusion is called a fae being or object's Mask, and their true form
 is called their Mein.
 Unlike a Luminous' Mundane Form, this illusion has no effect on magical
 forces.
 The mundane senses of magical beings are fooled, but their powers are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Fae only see the Mein of their fellows.
 They must spend a Glamour to see another's mask for a few brief seconds.
 In response, another fae may spend a Glamour to reinforce her mask, hiding
 her Mein even from other fae – leaving only a few tells such as her true
 form in her her shadow.
 Alternatively, a fae may spend a Glamour to burn away her Mask for a scene,
 revealing her true form in a dazzling magical display not unlike a Princess'
 transformation.
 This increases the effectiveness of the fae's Contracts and rends open
 gateways to Faerie nearby her.

 They not only looked upon the world in fixed, instinctive patterns, but
 came to see it as it truly was.
 Adrift, lost, and above all else, malleable.
 They saw that they could change the world, and that they did not exist
 to its whims.
 Only when we learned our future was ours to build, did humanity's true
 story begin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We looked upon a world that could be ours.
 Our nascent souls ignited in this revelation, sparking the one power we
 could truly call our own: Will.
 Through that power, we built our world of cities, roads and networks over
 generations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lineage the Maou inherit is cast down from that era, in all its glory
 and faults.
 They are the ones that maintain the path humanity set themselves on generations
 ago.
 They vow to maintain humanity on the true path, pruning the branches that
 would lead humanity back into the chaos and wilderness of old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their Ancestry reflects the ideals they hold, and the path they wish to
 see humanity continue down.
 Their Keystone is the means by which they anchor their Will into a coherent
 force.

\begin_layout Standard
Every human dreams in the night, even if they forget it in the day.
 We dream of impossible worlds that could never be, and wish with all our
 hearts to make them so regardless.
 The Keystone of Dreams holds the power to bind them into reality, upending
 natural law in favor of the light of stories and dreams.
 It holds the power to connect dreams, allowing those who would never meet
 in reality to know each other in a way siblings and lovers would envy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is all true, and yet, it is no longer a power of the Maou.
 In an era before the first records were written into history, the first
 Dreamers built their own worlds into the Astral, a reflection of what they
 wished the world to be.
 Through their ephemeral touch, they built families and small communities
 bound by shared understanding.
 Through their Light, they erased the pains of the world and brought what
 would be tragedies towards better endings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dreamers always imagined what the world could be if it were only a small
 bit fundamentally different, rather than looking to the here and now.
 When they wanted to prepare for tomorrow, and the Maou wanted to live for
 today, they always fought.
 The two sides drifted apart, sketching the shape of an inevitable tragedy
 to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who hold the Keystone of Dreams are Luminous, the wayward children
 of the Lineage.
 They are the ones who dream of worlds far better than those the Maou build,

The World of Darkness is filled with all kinds of supernatural beings, all

 Luminous and Maou alike often cross paths with them in the course of their

Kinship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous in their Dream Form have the same Kinship with Beasts as Mages

 With her mundane self grounding her in humanity, a Beast's arguments of
 Kinship often fall flat.
 Thicker Than Water has no effect on her in either of her forms.

Interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changelings and Luminous both touch on dreams and stories, if from opposite
 directions.
 Both seek comfort in their friends and support systems.
 Those similarities lead to a few interactions between their powers and
 worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Clarity and Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clarity and Hope are very similar mechanics, both serving as a health-like
 track that replaces Integrity.
 Supernatural powers that can effect either Hope or Clarity should apply
 to the other without modifications.
 Supernatural powers that do not involve some component of genuine interaction
 cannot heal Hope.
 A Mage spell would not have much significant effect in restoring Hope,
 but the Fortifying Presence Contract can heal Hope as easily as Clarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one of a Changeling's Touchstones possesses Sensitivity, they may use
 Take their Hand to heal Clarity, not only Hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the Storyteller's discretion, Changelings with the Sensitivity merit
 may suffer Clarity damage and Clarity conditions rather than Hope conditions
 alone, using the same mechanics as for Luminous.
 Roll Clarity attacks caused by Sensitivity using the rules for Hope attacks
 – the Changeling simply takes mild Clarity damage equal to the number of
 successes the attack shows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Hedge and The Dream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magic of the Luminous is centered upon shaping their own Dreams, and
 imposing it upon reality to begin with.
 Hedgespinning comes as naturally to them as any fae creature, and they
 may simply pay Motes in place of Glamour.
 They cannot shape the Hedge as they do the Dream – while it responds to
 emotion and thought, it is still a solid world of its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, Changelings in the Dream (as the Luminous define it) may Dreamweave
 as in personal dreams.
 They lose this power in the hearts of the Dream Kingdoms or the Deep Dream.
 She may apply Dreamweaving successes make Conceptual Attacks if her actions
 could justify doing so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maou may similarly Hedgespin by paying Motes, but cannot do so as naturally.
 They cannot perform Paradigm shifts, and must possess Fabula ••• or Prisma

Dreams and fae magic are closely tied.

\begin_layout Section
Demon: the Descent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous hold the power to connect people's hearts, and Demons hide powers
 to lie to the world itself.
 Their powers inevitably conflict, and worse yet, the two cannot simply
 avoid each other.
 Both veil themselves as mundane humans, and they cannot recognize each
 other for what they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Bonds and Lies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Demon's may lies fool the Dream itself.
 If he hides his true feelings from the one he loves, he may suppress bonds
 of Intimacy that would normally be woven.
 If he presents himself as feeling closer to someone than he does, he may
 create bonds of Intimacy he does not truly mean.
 However, to create a false bond of Intimacy like that means to put one's
 self at the mercy of a Luminous' Echo.
 Her power was not meant to be lied to, and it acts unwittingly to create
 a bond rather than reinforce one that already exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as a Demon fakes Strong Intimacy with a Luminous, her Echo conducts
 Social Maneuvering against the Demon with the goal to bring his true feelings
 in line with his false Intimacy.
 Every week, she rolls Power + Resonate - the Demon's Composure to attempt
 to open a door.
 Should he fake an Connected Intimacy instead, this roll gains the rote
 quality and occurs once per night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Echoes, thankfully, cannot reveal a Demon's nature to the Luminous.
 It treats a Demon's Covers as if they were protected by a Luminous' Dual
 Identity, even at Strong or Connected Intimacy.
 This does not require a roll and is not Spoofing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Weave of Bonds fundamentally destroys the separation Liar's Tongue relies
 on – it has no effect on a Demon's Partner.
 Any Demon who would willingly accept such a Weave, though, would likely
 consider this a benefit more than an downside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This was a hard one to figure out.
 Demons lie, their deceptions and the Pacts that force them are so core
 to their splat.
 Luminous have a power that connects hearts.
 Every Demon power that reflects their abilities to lie draw on the separation
 between their bodies and their minds.
 Which...
 doesn't help much when Luminous connect minds directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Still, it isn't any good if Demons are stymied from making Pacts with a
 Luminous even tangentially involved.
 Hence, the Echo is...
 a danger for Demons, but not one that stops them from trying.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Pacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demon Pacts do not pierce a Luminous' Dual Identity, unless the Demon is
 aware of it and specifically writes the Pact to account for her two forms.
 Thus, a Luminous could trade away her relationship with a friend in Mundane
 Form to a Demon, and still maintain that relationship in her Dream Form
 – and in fact, this is the default for Demons unaware of her nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a Soul Pact treats her two forms separately.
 A Soul Pact with a Luminous' Mundane Form gives the Demon her entire mundane
 life as usual – however, the Luminous may live on through her Dream Form
 (with the usual effects of Fading).
 A Soul Pact with a Luminous' Dream Form consumes both her identities, annihilat
ing her entirely.
 This has the usual effects of a Demon attempting to take a supernatural
 soul as a Cover.

While Mages hae a separate system of Withstand instead of the usual contested

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of Mage, Defiant Will is somewhat broader than its description
 would imply.
 Attempts to use Death to influence a Willful's soul, or use Space to affect
 a Luminous' relationships with anyone them have Strong or Connected Intimacy
 with also trigger Defiant Will, in addition to the obvious Mind effects.
 More indirect Arcana like Fate or Time are not impeded.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Arcana and Willful Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magic of the Luminous and Maou have varied effects on the world, and
 hence the best Arcana to use depends the power being studied.
 Luminous magic tends to work by means similar to the Mind, Space and Forces
 Arcana.
 Maou magic tends to work by means similar to the Fate, Mind and Matter
 Arcana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The description of powers have more influence than their effects – for example,
 while Mages would normally achieve effects like Shining Vow using Fate,
 the Charm would be best studied using the Mind Arcana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Dream Form is obviously a projection of her dreams under Mind
 Mage Sight, and other Arcana treat her as what she appears to be.
 Normally Life is required to affect her as with most living beings, but
 some Luminous may have less conventional forms.
 A Luminous' Echo is best studied with Mind and Space.Bonds of Intimacy are
 usually similar to the corresponding Sympathetic ties.
 If needed, a Mage may add Mind 1 to Space spells to specifically view or
 manipulate Intimacy.

Motes and Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Mages, Motes are something very similar to Willpower – simply found in
 an abnormal abundance for a normal human.
 As it is not truly a form of energy, the most Mages can do is drain a Mote
 Pool as a Mind Unraveling spell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a Luminous' Hope is simply a measurement of their mental stability.
 To a Mage, does not feel as if a source of supernatural power at all.
 A Mage may cause mild Hope damage equal to Potency with a Mind Flaying
 spell, or severe damage with a Mind Unraveling spell.
 Healing Hope damage is far harder as magically granted emotional strength
 does not fuel a Luminous' magic.
 In mechanical terms, the most a Mage can do to help with Hope is cure Hope
 Conditions, not heal the underlying Hope damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Commentary

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transferring Motes would cause a lot of balance issues.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Giving anyone the ability to restore Hope by fiat would also break the game's
 themes.
 Luminous have to struggle versus Hope, and any powerful enough healing
 ability, in my opinion, will damage that severely.
 Changeling's Clarity recovery Contract works because it's so mild, and
 has a significant social interaction component.
 It makes

Soul Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Luminous call their dream worlds Soulspaces, they is more a modificati
on of their Oneiros than a soul as a Mage would call it.
 They still have a true soul, which is treated as an Awakened Soul, even
 in Mundane Form.
 Dual Identity cloaks this fact, and a Mage who tries to use the spell 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

Sever Soul

 on an untransformed Luminous does not learn why her spell has failed and
 her powers do not detect her soul as anything other than mundane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, Luminous do not suffer from Soul Loss as most beings do.
 The root cause of Fading is not the lack of a physical body – but rather
 their lack of a soul as Mages would recognize it.
 Luminous suffer a variant of Fading instead of Soul Loss.
 As long her as her physical body remains alive, she may still transform
 and still has a Mundane Form.
 Should she Fade in such a state, she loses all Luminous powers and gains
 the Thrall condition [M:tAw 318].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a Luminous can more or less sustain herself indefinitely without a soul,
 it's far from unheard of for Luminous aware of this fact to offer their
 own souls to save someone from Soul Loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maou are far less interesting in this regard.
 Their souls are treated as Awakened Souls.
 They do not innately lose their ability to use their magic when Soulless;
 however because Willpower is their core resources, they will suffer magically
 for it as well.
