# Introduction

::::: {.twocolumnfill}

When we were young, we looked upon the world with wonder. We saw magic in the flowers and birds, and every other little thing. We looked up to the stars, and imagined holding them in our hands. When we read stories of great heroes and magical girls and knights and princesses, we were inspired. We thought we could truly be like them, and make the world a better place...

If only our dreams could come true, we could save our friends from their cruel parents and our families from the uncaring world — but, those dreams never came to pass, as years and then decades went by...

When we were older, we were taught that the world was supposed to be a dark and pitiless place. That the wonders of nature were something to fear, and that the stars were too far away to reach. Those people who truly could change the world were special, out of reach, and nobody like us could ever hope to try. It was hubris. We weren't meant to amount to anything. All we could do to survive is give up on hope, and follow along. Only someone childish, someone naive could believe otherwise.

**Luminous: the Dream** is a story of those who stand in defiance against that cynicism, dreaming of the better future we were meant to forget. About growing up to unlearn the lies of adulthood, and remembering the hope we had for a better world and the wonders we were taught to overlook.

## Setting

**Luminous: the Dream** is a roleplaying game inspired by the *mahou shoujo* genre of anime. It is set in the world of the **Chronicles of Darkness**, where humanity is caught between supernatural horrors hide under the surface and the familiar cruelties of modern life. More than in our world, humanity learned that the only way to survive was to keep their heads down, pretend everything was alright.

It wasn't always that way. We once dreamed of a better future, and the magic we would use to reclaim the world from its horrors. That hope ignited across a sea of fragmented dreams. When they joined together, they gave birth to the Dream Kingdom we named Annwn, shining with all our brightest dreams of the day we would conquer the dark...

There, the first glimmers of a magic we could truly call our own were first formed.

... but it wasn't to last. Our dreams were too far away. Now, the Dream Kingdom is fading away, forgotten by a world that no longer believes in hope. To a world that believed that they must give up their future to survive just another day... dreams were foolish. Dreams were dangerous, and childish.

In this game, you play one of the Luminous — one of the last champions of the Dream Kingdom, wielding an ancient magic that never had a chance to truly shine... and carry forth the light of a dying dream once more into the world.

Of course... that path would be difficult and full of pain. But, what other option is there? After all, there is a brighter future to fight for.

## Required Books

**Luminous: the Dream** is a fangame for Chronicles of Darkness and does not contain the core rules needed to play the Storyteller system. You will require one of the following books:

* **Chronicles of Darkness** ([DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/168428/Chronicles-of-Darkness)) contains the core rules for the Storyteller system.
* The core book for an official supernatural splat (such as **Changeling: the Lost 2e** or **Mage: the Awakening 2e**) also contain the core rules for the system. The page numbers found in this book will not be accurate, but conversions may be found in the appendix.

In addition, the following books are recommended for traditional magical girl chronicles involving younger characters, but are not required:

* **Fragile Innocence** by Erica Mahoney ([Storyteller's Vault](https://www.storytellersvault.com/product/462836/Fragile-Innocence)) contains updated rules for playing child and teenager characters in Chronicles of Darkness.
* **World of Darkness: Innocents** ([DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/55727/World-of-Darkness-Innocents)) is a source book for such characters from an earlier edition of World of Darkness. The rules are outdated and superseded by Fragile Innocence, but the roleplaying hints, chronicle ideas and merits found in this book are still usable.

## Themes

**Luminous** is built to tell stories in the tone of the darker examples of the _mahou shoujo_ or "magical girl" genre of anime. Those stories don't shy away from the serious pains and adult concerns of the world, and yet still tell of the hope that exists even in the worst of circumstances and how those living in such a world can grow beyond the traumas it caused.

### The Journey of Hope

For most, growing up means to give up on hope. In everyone else's eyes, you're supposed to accept the world as it is, and stop fighting. They say it's _more mature_, it's the _right thing to do_. They say that to believe the world could be better is childish, and that is something to hold contempt for.

You know in your heart that that's wrong. You saw how much the world can change when people try, even without any special power.

But... that doesn't mean it's easy either. The world isn't easy to change, and it became the way it is for a reason. Even if you know it's a lie, it's still seductive to believe that the world can't be changed, so... it's okay to not try. It's still tempting to simply give up and tell yourself that all it means is that you've grown up now. It's still easy to fall into blind idealism, ignoring the dark side of the world entirely...

The stories of magical girl media are about _growing up_, to come to understand the world you live in for all its faults and brightness... and find your own path through it regardless.

### Crossing Paths

Everyone's lives are different. That doesn't mean, though, that we are alone. We all still rely on others, love others, have been hurt by others.

The Luminous come to understand that truth better than anyone else. Their magic draws on their bonds with those around them, and thus, to them... their relationships aren't only a source of emotional strength and support, but the very magic they use to better the world.

In their stories, they come to meet those far different from them. People with different ideals, people who see the world differently and supernatural beings with fundamentally different minds and needs. Sometimes, conflict is unavoidable. But, other times... even seemingly impossible rifts can be bridged through simple understanding.

### Lights in the Dark

The world isn't all dark. No matter how bad the situation gets, no matter how far the world slips into darkness... there will always be light in the world. Luminous, at its heart, is a story about those lights.

There will always be small moments of happiness and hidden places of beauty hidden away. Even if the Luminous fail to change the world, and even if they can't stop Annwn from fading away... those small moments still mattered. The Dream was woven from tiny sparks after all, rather than some grand tale...

For the Luminous, it is those small and precious moments that push them forward, and give them the strength to fight. And... they hope, it will be those that inspire others to fight alongside them.

## Inspirations

The following is a small sample of stories and works that have inspired **Luminous** and its themes.

### Senki Zesshou Symphogear

Symphogear follows the story of Hibiki, an ordinary girl who ends up bound to an ancient relic, allowing her to transform and fight the Noise that threaten the world. At its heart, it is a story of heartfelt communication, the determination to protect those you love, and the sacrifices one makes to do so. About the scars of the past, and what must be done to heal them.

Hibiki stays strong in her belief to reach to the heart throughout, fighting against people's despair as much she does the Noise. When the members of the cast suffer tragedy, it is true their bonds with each other that they're able to stand up again.

### Magia Record

Magia Record is the spiritual successor to Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a dark magical girl story that helped to popularized the genre. For all its original is known for its darkness, though, it is still a story of hope and love. It is no wonder then, that its successor too fits well as an inspiration for Luminous chronicles.

The anime and video game pivots the focus more to human responses to the woes of magic. It embraces the personal stories that underlie Madoka's cosmic story, focusing on the relationships between magical girls and the friends that pull them back from the brink of despair. The phone game, in particular, tells the kinds of slice-of-life story Luminous embraces – of magical girls who care for and love each other.

### Library of Ruina

Library of Ruina is a video game by Project Moon, following the story of the people who staff a magical library. Through its powers, they learn the stories of the City they live in and thus explore the traumas and emotional scars of both the librarians and the residents of the City. The story is deeply emotional, focusing on people's reactions to a dark world and how they – and the world can still change.

Both the main protagonists, Angela and Roland have their own dark pasts and scars that are revealed through the game's progress, and learn to overcome them to see the hope that still remains in their world.

### Honkai Impact 3rd

Honkai Impact 3rd is a long running video game by Hoyoverse, about a group of young girls growing up as they fight to protect they world they live in. In time, they learn the truth behind the Houkai that threatens their world and how greatly their world was influenced by the civilizations of the past.

The contrast between the stories of the Previous Era and Current Era especially resonate with the themes of **Luminous** – showing how humanity has a real decision to make in what they believe in and what kind of world they create.
