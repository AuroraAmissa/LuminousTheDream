# Introduction

::::: {.twocolumnfill}
When we were young, we looked to the world with wonder. We looked to the flowers and trees and birds and every little thing about them felt magical. We saw the stars, and imagined holding them in our hands. We saw the great heroes of the world and thought we could be like them as well. We read fantastical stories of magical girls and knights and princesses and wished they were real. We thought we could change the world, and make it a better place for all.

So, why was the world the way it was?

As we grew, we were taught that the world was a dark and dull place. The natural world was something to fear. The stars were too far away to reach. The great heroes of the world were special and we weren't. We wouldn't amount to anything unless we gave up on hope and followed along. Only someone childish, someone naive could believe otherwise.

We were taught to forget those stories we once loved, of children carrying on innocent hope to save the world. Stories for adults were darker, more realistic, more true.

**Luminous: the Dream** is such a childish and puerile story, of hope, of warriors who draw the magic from the world of dreams itself.

It is a story about unlearning the lies of adulthood, and remembering the hope we had for a better world. It is a story about learning to see the wonders of the world again, and protecting them with all our might. It is the story about embracing the wonder and hope of childhood, not because we know nothing else or hide from the world's shadows, but because that is the correct way forward.

## Setting

**Luminous: the Dream** is a roleplaying game set in the world of the **Chronicles of Darkness**, a world much like our own - caught between the familiar horrors of the mundane and the unfamiliar horrors of the supernatural. More than in our own world, humanity learned to keep its head down to survive. This game, though, isn't about doing that.

In the depths of the collective dreams of humanity, there was a forgotten Dream Kingdom. In it, we built countless visions of what the world could be if only we worked hard enough. There, we lit the first faint sparks of a power we could truly call our own. There, we made our first stand against the malice of the world.

The spark was too faint in the end, and the wonders too distant. When we found a different path, one of science and cold rationality over the warmth of love and the romance of stories, we forgot the Dream Kingdom as any more than a story.

You play a Luminous in this game, a champion of the Dream Kingdom in an era where people no longer believe in the power of dreams.

Helpless to change the world that caused them and all they loved so much suffering, they escaped into the depths of their dreams. There, though, they found that lost Kingdom, and the ancient stories of hope and wonder it told of. They met others who held the same hope they do, who wished to change the world as they did, in any small way they can. They saw the small acts of kindness that existed even in the waking world.

Somehow, through all that, a long forgotten power awoke in their soul – to weave their imagination into reality, and stand against the world once more in the name of dreams.

The path forward would be difficult and full of suffering and pain. But, how could they take any other path? After all, they alone held the power to change all that.

## Source Books

Luminous: the Dream is a fangame for Chronicles of Darkness and does not contain the core rules needed to play the Storyteller system. You will require one of the following books:

* **Chronicles of Darkness** ([DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/168428/Chronicles-of-Darkness)) contains the core rules for the Storyteller system.
* The core book for an official supernatural splat (such as **Changeling: the Lost 2e** or **Promethean: the Created**) also contain the core rules for the system. The page references found in this book will not be accurate, but conversions may be found in the appendix.

In addition, the following books are recommended for traditional magical girl chronicles involving younger characters, but are not required:

* **Fragile Innocence** by Erica Mahoney ([Storyteller's Vault](https://www.storytellersvault.com/product/462836/Fragile-Innocence)) contains updated rules for playing child and teenager characters in Chronicles of Darkness.
* **World of Darkness: Innocents** ([DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/55727/World-of-Darkness-Innocents)) is a source book for such characters from an earlier edition of World of Darkness. The rules are outdated and superseded by Fragile Innocence, but the roleplaying hints, chronicle ideas and merits found in this book are still usable.

## Themes

**Luminous** is built to tell stories in the tone of the darker adaptations of the mahou shoujo genre of anime. Those stories embrace the darkest corners of life without shy away, and yet, refuse to let them consume them, showing how hope can live on even in a dark world.

### The Journey of Hope

For most, growing up means to give up on hope. It's what you were taught growing up, after all. Tomorrow always seemed too far away to care about, better to struggle through today. It's better to not stick your head out. Put childish things behind you, so you won't suffer any longer. After all, if things can't be changed, you don't have to think so hard about how bad the world is. It is as good as it could ever be.

You know it's wrong. You saw how much even a small wish can change the world, even without the spark of magic. You see that if people truly try, the cruelties of the world could be changed. But doubt still rings in your ears.

The lie that the world can't be changed is still seductive. To hold onto the hope, and truly wield it to change the world also means to confront all the malice of its world in its full horror.

### Crossing Paths

Everyone's lives leads them in different directions, and yet we are all interconnected. Nobody is truly alone. Every person relies on another, loves another, has been hurt by another. The Luminous know that truth better than anyone else. Their Dream Kingdom, after all, was built in the Sea of Stars that connects the dreams of all humanity together.

It's all too easy to reject those who are different, cast them away as outsiders. In understanding them, you learn that they simply want to live like everyone else, another part of the greater whole.

On their journey walking in between dreams and reality, the Luminous come to rely on and understand the very different people and supernatural creatures they share a world with. With the help of those others, their dream seems every the more possible.

### Lights in the Dark

Despite the problems of the world, there are still small moments of happiness and hidden places of beauty everywhere. It's all too easy to explain them away, and dismiss them as not worth it or simply boring. For every grand spectacles, there are a thousand small wonders. In truth, the places we escape to in our vacations aren't all that different, we just give ourselves permission to truly feel the joy in those small things.

Even if they can't change the whole world, even if they can't stop their Kingdom from fading away, the Luminous can still protect those small moments. By living a life full of wonder, they could show the world around them that there is still hope and light in the world.

The Dream was woven from such small things in the first place, and grew into a force that still burns on in its darkest era. Surely, that flame could be ignited again.

## Inspirations

The following is a small sample of stories and works that have inspired **Luminous** and its themes.

### Senki Zesshou Symphogear

Symphogear follows the story of Hibiki, an ordinary girl who ends up bound to an ancient relic, allowing her to transform and fight the Noise that threaten the world. At its heart, it is a story of heartfelt communication, the determination to protect those you love, and the sacrifices one makes to do so. About the scars of the past, and what must be done to heal them.

Hibiki stays strong in her belief to reach to the heart throughout, fighting against people's despair as much she does the Noise. When the members of the cast suffer tragedy, it is true their bonds with each other that they're able to stand up again.

### Magia Record

Magia Record is the spiritual successor to Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a dark magical girl story that helped to popularized the genre. For all its original is known for its darkness, though, it is still a story of hope and love. It is no wonder then, that its successor too fits well as an inspiration for Luminous chronicles.

The anime and video game pivots the focus more to human responses to the woes of magic. It embraces the personal stories that underlie Madoka's cosmic story, focusing on the relationships between magical girls and the friends that pull them back from the brink of despair. The phone game, in particular, tells the kinds of slice-of-life story Luminous embraces – of magical girls who care for and love each other.

### Library of Ruina

Library of Ruina is a video game by Project Moon, following the story of the people who staff a magical library. Through its powers, they learn the stories of the City they live in and thus explore the traumas and emotional scars of both the librarians and the residents of the City. The story is deeply emotional, focusing on people's reactions to a dark world and how they – and the world can still change.

Both the main protagonists, Angela and Roland have their own dark pasts and scars that are revealed through the game's progress, and learn to overcome them to see the hope that still remains in their world.

### Honkai Impact 3rd

Honkai Impact 3rd is a long running video game by Hoyoverse, about a group of young girls growing up as they fight to protect they world they live in. In time, they learn the truth behind the Houkai that threatens their world and how greatly their world was influenced by the civilizations of the past.

The contrast between the stories of the Previous Era and Current Era especially resonate with the themes of **Luminous** – showing how humanity has a real decision to make in what they believe in and what kind of world they create.
