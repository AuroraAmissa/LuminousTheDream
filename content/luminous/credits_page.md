#### Special Thanks {.u .tex_h2}

AnemoneMeer, Suzune, Ellie, MushroomBadger, Hanako, Xelsius, and so many more members of the Discord who helped me refine the fansplat and find direction early on.

All the authors of **Princess: the Hopeful**, whose project inspired this one - especially back in the days when it was still **Princess: the Fading**.

The authors of **Changeling: the Dreaming** and **Graceful Wicked Masques**, whose works influenced Luminous greatly.

Madeleine L'Engle, whose books taught me what it meant to dream.

#### Content Warning {.u .tex_h2}

**Luminous: the Dream** tells stories of both the escapism of dreams and the cruelties of reality. This book discusses subject matters such as poverty, sexism, racism, and all kinds of the mundane and small cruelties that are too often overlooked. Beyond that, its supernatural elements involve themes of rejection of reality, and blurred boundaries between people.

If you are sensitive to such content, please take care when reading or playing **Luminous**. Safety techniques for such things are discussed in [TODO: Chapter link].
