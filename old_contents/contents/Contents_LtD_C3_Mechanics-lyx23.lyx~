Luminous find themselves caught between two worlds, existing at once as
 a living dream and an ordinary human.
 Somewhere in between, they find the power they wield to create the future
 they wish for.
 The rules in this chapter show you how to create a Luminous character,
 and the special rules and abilities they possess.

 In a roleplay system like 
\series bold
Chronicles of Darkness
\series default
, you have to flesh out the heart of who your character is in terms of its
 rules.
 Every player will need a character sheet for Luminous – either the online
 version designed for internet games, or the offline printable version for
 in-person games.
 That sheet will be your guide to character creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
All the players in a chronicle should create their characters together if
 at all possible.
 
\series bold
Luminous: the Dream
\series default
 especially focuses on relationships, and the bonds between people – it
 helps to have who other people are playing and how your character relates
 to them in mind even during the earlier stages of character creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step One: Character Concept
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The first part of character creation is to come up with a rough idea of
 who you want to play.
 What was her upbringing like, and who are her friends in either world?
 Does she consider herself a resident of the dream, or merely a visitor?
 What problems does she see in the waking world, and what does she want
 to do about them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You should solidify her whole concept into a single coherent high concept,
 such as 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

children's writers who finds inspiration in dreams
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

blogger who sways minds through her words and dreams
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

peacekeeper for Seattle's supernatural beings
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

.
 You can refer back to it when deciding what options fit your character
 better, and refine it as your character develops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Aspirations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Aspirations are the main way your character earns Beats and thus advances
 their abilities.
 They help the Storyteller know what you want to do as your character, and
 the kinds of stories you want to experience through them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous have five Aspirations; two more than usual.
 Most of them should be short-term goals that can be completed in a session
 or two, and one or two should be a longer-term goal that may take a whole
 Chapter or longer.
 The division Luminous often feel between their mundane and dream selves
 is reflected in their Aspirations.
 Of her five, two of them must relate to the waking world or her mundane
 life.
 The other two must relate to her life in the Dream or her supernatural
 life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Does she have something she wants to do with her friends in either world?
 Is there a community she is important to? What is her school life or job
 like, and is there something she wants to do there? How does she use magic
 to make the waking world a better place?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Don't be afraid of writing Aspirations that add little bits of context to
 your character, even if they are easy to fulfill.
 For example, a simple one like 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

Find a place to live
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 establishes that your character doesn't currently have one and one like
 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

Reconnect with my cousin
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 is a great excuse to get the party together – assuming that cousin is another
 player character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Two: Select Attributes

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dream Attributes
\end_layout

\end_inset

 All characters have nine mundane attributes representing their innate mundane
 capabilities.
 Each starts with one free dot.
 Pick an category of attributes (Physical, Mental, and Social) to distribute
 5 dots within, another category to distribute 4 dots within, then distribute
 3 dots to the last category.
 Afterwards, assign your character's 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
hyperref[Sec-TransformedAttrs]{dream attributes}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Start with one dot in each, then distribute 8 dots between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Two dots in an attribute is normal human ability.
 One dots is a notable difficiency, three dots is above average, four is
 remarkable, and five is the limits of human ability.
 Anything above that is outright superhuman; beyond any mundane human's
 ability.
 Luminous may never have mundane attributes or skills over 5 dots, and cannot
 have Dream attributes over 6 dots at character creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Three: Select Skills 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Weaving Skills
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Skills work similarly to attributes, representing learned skills and training.
 Assign her mundane skills in the same way as attributes, except skills
 begin with no dots.
 Assign 11 dots to one category, 7 to the second, and 4 to the last.
 Similarly, they assign their 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
hyperref[Sec-TransformedSkills]{Weaving Skills}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 like their dream attributes.
 Assign 15 dots between her Weaving Skills, none of which may exceed 6 at
 character creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Four: Skill Specialties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You start with three Skill Specialties in your mundane skills.
 They represent your character's best skills in a given field, as opposed
 to the broader competence Skill dots represent.
 You may choose skill specialties freely, writing down whatever feels appropriat
e to your character.
 As usual, this is a chance to refine your idea of who your character is.
 A specialty for Expression (Poetry) implies someone perhaps more artistic,
 while Expression (Public Speaking) implies someone more persuasive and
 social.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At this point, you're ready to deal with the outright magical aspects of
 your character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Luminary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When she Blossoms, a Luminous grasps at the symbols of the Dream to truly
 stabilize the nascent power she would come to wield.
 The first of these she takes on is her 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Sec-Luminary"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the celestial light she patterns her magic after.
 It forms the basis of how she uses her magic, and decides whether she focuses
 on Regalia, Domains or Charms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Read over the three Luminaries you may pick (Sunlight, Moonlight and Starlight),
 and choose the one that fits your character concept the best.
 It may well be that she could fit into multiple Luminaries.
 In that case, base your decision on what kind of power you think your character
 would be the most comfortable wielding, if their personality could go either
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Archetype 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Whether your character would be a shining hero, an idol whose songs change
 the world, or a shrine maiden that upholds the boundary between worlds,
 she is yet still a Luminous.
 The dreams of humanity shift with the stories they tell, and the Luminous
 often end up reflecting them as well.
 Your character's Archetype represents the form she takes in her dreams,
 and the ideals she evokes in her appearance and style.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Read over the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Sec-Archetype"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and choose one that your character would wish to be.
 If you wish, you can work with your Storyteller to make a custom one, if
 you feel none of the ones here fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Kingdom 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Starlit Dream stabilized into eight great 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Sec-Kingdoms"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, each a vision of what the waking world could one day be, with just a slight
 touch of magic.
 Luminous draw the magics they always wielded in their dream into reality,
 invoking the underlying principles and feelings that their Kingdoms represent.
 Read over the Kingdoms and choose the one that your character would most
 believe in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dream & Wish
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Choose your character's 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "subsec:Dream"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "subsec:Wish"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 While most mortals have a Virtue and a Vice, the Luminous draw on the things
 they can be sure of even in their dreams.
 Her Dream is vision of a better world she sees in her deepest dreams, and
 her Wish is the life she wishes to live and the person she wishes to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Invocations

 is the cumulation of the worldviews, and feelings reflected in one of the
 Dream Kingdoms.
 Luminous draw on them for power, channeling the symbols and magic each
 Kingdom had built over the long years for themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Each Luminous starts with three dots in Invocations, one of which must be
 placed in her Kingdom's Invocation.
 Kingdomless Luminous instead choose two Invocations to have affinity for.
 They must place at least one dot in each of the two Invocations.

 measures your character's ability to draw on the Dream's power, and project
 it onto reality.
 The higher it is, the more power she can draw on in her waking life, at
 the cost of losing herself in the dream she draws on for power.
 It determines how many Motes your character can spend without cost each
 turn, and the number of Regalia she may sustain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous begin with a free dot of Reverie.
 You may purchase additional dots for five of your starting Merit dots each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Six: Merits 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Your character starts with 10 dots of Merits due to being a supernatural
 being.
 You may spend them on any merits your character qualifies for.

When a Luminous awakens from her Realization, she finds herself lost between
 the dreams she always escaped to and a world far larger and far more colorful
 than she ever knew.
 The concerns of the mundane world are at once further away and more pressing
 than ever before.
 After all, for the first time...
 they could do something about them.

 In the flows of the Dream, the Starborn could walk from story to story,
 always being thrust into a different role in each.
 What is a virtue in one world is a mortal sin in another.
 In the mundane world, they are as bound by its rules as any other, surviving
 like anyone else does.
 As to not be cast adrift, as to not lose sight of themselves, the Luminous
 cling to those things they know are their own, no matter where they end
 up or what kind of role they are thrust into.

 A Luminous' Dream is the vision they see of a better tomorrow.
 They can't pretend the world is just the way it should be.
 They can't pretend that when something bad happens to someone, they must
 deserve it.
 Without those illusions to cling to, what they have left is the hope that
 some day...
 that dream can come true.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Through that Dream, a Hopeful remembers what the better world she fights
 for looks like.
 At the end of a scene, if a Luminous takes a risk to make her Dream a reality,
 even in a small way, she regains one Willpower.
 If she makes noticeable progress in realizing her Dream, she regains all
 Willpower.

 Helping others means to be selfish sometimes.
 The Luminous know that better than any other, as heightened as their feelings
 are.
 They could never hope to hold onto their strength without realizing that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Through her Wish, a Hopeful finds comfort in an often harsh and unforgiving
 world.
 At the end of a scene, if she overcame a challenge or took a risk to express
 her Wish, she regain one Willpower.
 If she takes a significant risk or abandoned an important task to express
 her Wish, she regains all Willpower.

 By nature, a Luminous' magic drives her to live two seperate lives – one
 as a normal mortal, and another as a living dream.
 Due to that balancing act, Luminous have five Aspirations rather than the
 usual three.
 They must select at least two relating to their mundane life or their responsbi
lities in the waking world, and must select at least two relating to the
 supernatural world or their life in the Dream.

 In the Starlit Dream and the hearts of those influenced by it, the bonds
 of love and friendship are as tangible a thing as any material thing.
 Such connections are represented by Intimacy, a measure of how close two
 people are that can take up any of five levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Connected:
\series default
 Two people have Connected Intimacy if they are close enough to be effectively
 inseparable.
 This includes life-long partners who never leave each other's side, or
 those bound by magical ties such as a fae Oath of love or the

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Strong:
\series default
 Two people have Strong Intimacy when they share much of their lives with
 each other, often confiding in each other for comfort and support.
 This includes married couple, very close friends, parents and their children,
 or families of choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Medium:
\series default
 Two people have Medium Intimacy when they are on friendly terms with each
 other and know about each other's lives in broad terms.
 This includes good friends, confidants, most siblings or a typical dating
 couple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Weak:
\series default
 Two people have Weak Intimacy if they have met before, but rarely with
 any particular emotional depth.
 This includes coworkers, gaming partners, extended family or the friend
 of a friend.
 Hostile relationships often also fall under this category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
None:
\series default
 Luminous gain no benefit from relationships more tenuous than those described
 by Weak Intimacy.
 Strangers walking down the street, people a Luminous has just met, or other
 similarly distant people fall under this category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Regardless of the depth of the connection, the feelings must be mutual.
 If the two participants have different feelings towards each other, the
 lower Intimacy implied is used.
 A therapist may know a lot about her patients, but this often only results
 in Weak Intimacy because they rarely truly form mutual bonds in their professio
n.
 As much as the fans of an idol may know about her, no ties of Intimacy
 are formed due to those fans blending into a faceless crowd to her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
High Intimacy provides a bonus to some Luminous ability, and low Intimacy
 inflicts a penalty on others.
 Connected Intimacy provides an Intimacy Bonus of +6 and inflicts no Intimacy
 Penalty.
 Strong Intimacy provides a bonus of +4, and inflicts a penalty of -4.
 Weak Intimacy provides a bonus of +2 and inflicts a penalty of -4.
 Weak Intimacy provides no bonus and inflicts a penalty of -8.
 Without at least Weak Intimacy, abilities that take a penalty from low
 Intimacy automatically fail.

 Even if the waking world asks the Luminous to harden their heart, to grow
 up, to stop caring...
 they can't.
 The deep emotion and stories of the Dream are so deeply woven into their
 being.
 No matter how long they live, they experience the triumphs and struggles
 of their life with all the intensity as they first felt them in childhood.
 Small cruelties deeply wound them as much as quiet beauty and small joys
 give them the energy to move forward regardless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hope represents that drive, the emotional strength that Luminous draw on.
 When they are full of light and confidence, Hope fuels their magic and
 pushes them forward.
 When their Hope is depleted, they are emotionally drained and have more
 and more difficulty holding onto the dreams that power their magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Hope Track and Damage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous have a Hope track equal to their transformed Power + Resistance
 that behaves similarly to a health track.
 When an ability refers to a character's Hope, it means the number of undamaged
 Hope boxes she possesses.
 Luminous are considered to have an Integrity equivalent equal to 5 + her
 undamaged Hope boxes (to a maximum of 10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Hope track may be marked with two different kinds of damage.
 Mild Hope damage represents simpler emotional strain from her overexerting
 her magic or simply the weight of life bearing down on her without a release.
 Severe Hope damage represents fundamentally deeper pains that linger, even
 when the situation clears up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Each time a Luminous takes Hope damage, mark it off her Hope track using
 a slash (/) for mild damage and an (X) for severe damage.
 Mark mild damage in the leftmost empty box of her Hope track, and severe
 damage in the leftmost empty box or the leftmost box that is marked with
 only mild damage.
 Whenever a Princess takes mild Hope damage when her rightmost Hope box
 is filled, she instead takes a point of severe Hope damage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Hope Recovery
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The realities of life are harsh, and its happy moments fleeting.
 Even if they don't last, though...
 those moments still give the Hopeful strength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once a day, whenever a Luminous spends a scene relaxing or doing something
 she enjoys, roll Hope as a dice pool.
 She clears a box of mild Hope damage for each success.
 If there are still consequences for failure or she is putting off important
 matters to do so, she may only restore up to one Hope damage in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Once a week, in place of the usual Hope recovery, she may take a significant
 amount of time confiding in someone she is close to or otherwise shares
 her struggles.
 When she does so, she adds a bonus to her Hope recovery roll equal to her
 Intimacy bonus with that person, and may clear boxes of severe Hope damage
 in addition to mild.

Attacks against Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When something shakes a Luminous' resolve or emotional stability, she takes
 an attack against Hope.
 Attacks have a die rating and may deal mild or severe Hope damage.
 To resolve one, roll that number of dice.
 Your character takes damage equal to the number of successes of the correspondi
ng type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If she took any damage from this process and her rightmost box of Hope is
 marked with damage afterwards, she gains a Hope Condition, chosen by the
 player from the following list:

 emotional shock or significant emotional turmoil for personal reasons.

 If it were not for the Dream's power, Luminous would be normal people powerless
 to stand up against the supernatural.
 If it not were for their ties to the mundane world, they would be transient
 dreams as fleeting as any other.
 In the space in between, they can become something more.
 Reverie is a measure of how closely they can bring together those two worlds,
 and shape the world through their confluence.

As it increases, Luminous are able to have higher traits in Dream Form,
 maintain more magic at one time and spend more Motes without drawing on
 their Hope.
 However...
 it doesn't come without downsides.
 As a Hopeful's power grows she slowly loses her ability to keep a balance
 between dreams and reality, and adjusting back to her Mundane Form becomes
 increasingly difficult.

 Motes are the small shards of power the Luminous draw on to fuel their
 magic, gathered from deep within their own souls.
 They have a Mote Pool which refills to its capacity at the beginning of
 every scene.
 Beyond that, Luminous must draw on their own emotional strength to fuel
 their magics.
 For every Mote a Luminous spends with an empty Mote Pool, she takes a box
 of mild Hope damage, leaving her feeling down and exhausted until she has
 time to recover.

The Dream is full of bright and ever-changing stories, just as the waking
 world is filled with a peaceful and gentle mundane everyday life.
 Even when shadows threaten to choke both out, there are those Starborn
 who still cling to the beauty of both worlds.
 Their wish to stay and fight, to change the Dream and Earth alike for the
 better would ingite a shining light...

 Rather than accepting being torn between dreams and reality, the Luminous
 wished for a different path.
 Grasping the first sparks of magic they awoke in their Realization, they
 found a path to unify their dual nature, becoming something more than they
 could have in either world alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous have a Mundane Form reflecting their life on Earth and a Dream
 Form reflecting their life in the Starlit Kingdoms.
 Through their Transformation, they may take on the form and benefits of
 either side of their nature no matter where they find themselves.
 Switching between their two forms is a reflexive action that requires a
 Reverie + Hope roll.
 Should they fail, they take a Hope Condition and must spend a point of
 Willpower to transform anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transformation is a powerful and obvious act of Dreamweaving, usually manifestin
g as the Weaver's form shifting in colorful displays of light and sound.
 Though her Transformation's appearance is under her control, such a blatant
 defiance of reality's laws distorts the space around her.
 For a few moment, the world around her feels slightly less real as the
 concepts of her Dream leak through.
 Onlookers cant help but notice that something strange is happening, and
 their attention is always subtly pulled towards the Transformation.
 Noticing this consciously requires a Wits + Empathy check.
 Dreamborn automatically notice and recognize Transformation without a roll.

Luminous may take Merits that only function in one of their forms.
 For example, one could only have Striking Looks in her Dream Form, or only

 As an optional rule, the Storyteller may require this of all social merits
 representing relationships with other people, unless the player can justify
 them being available in both forms.

 The waking world isn't defined by the stars that shine the brightest but...

 Even those who would simply be background characters in the dream are deeply

In her Mundane Form, a Luminous is an ordinary mortal as any other.
 All supernatural effects treat her as if she were a normal mortal, whether
 this is beneficial or harmful to her.
 If she is aware that she is being targeted by such an ability, she may
 transform reflexively to avoid it.
 However, any effect that would cause her to cease being a Luminous or become
 a different type of supernatural being simply fails.
 At the Storyteller's discression, such effects may cause her to take on

Unlike most types of supernatural beings, Luminous may take supernatural
 merits.
 She may never gain a supernatural merit template in this way, and cannot
 use any of her supernatural merits in her Dream Form.

 The chaotic and wild stories of the Dream demand those within it shine

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In her Dream Form, a Luminous is one of those stars of the Kingdoms.
 She asserts her truest desires against the world, taking on a form reflecting
 who she would be in a world freed of all constraints.
 For some, that means simply donning a frilly magical girl dress, or suit
 of armor that shines impossibly in the sunlight.
 Others become all kinds of fantastical beings – winged sylphs, catgirls,
 all sorts of creatures of myth and stories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous in Dream Form are emphermeral beings in phase with the Dream.
 They have a Rank based on their Reverie, are always Manifested, and may

\end_layout

A Luminous' Dream Form always has a default Size of 5, regardless of her

 They have separate Form Merits that may be used to change this.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
By the nature of their Transformation, a Luminous rarely truly has to reveal
 that...
 they are the same person under it all, the shining dreamer and the ordinary
 mortal.
 Their magic grows to reflect this, ever so subtly shifting the perceptions
 of those around her to hide that fact.
 Regardless of how similar a Luminous looks in her two forms, anyone who
 meets her in both forms has an innate impression that they are different
 people and do not recognize the similarity on appearances or mannerisms
 alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Though Veiling protects against first impressions, the illusion is still
 rather fragile in the face of actual evidence or suspicion.
 She cannot simply dip into a closet to return as a mysterious magical girl,
 or transform in front of someone and expect her Veiling to protect her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even supernatural powers are fooled by this presumption.
 Magical senses like a vampire's taste for blood or a werewolf's scent tracking
 do not connect her two forms.
 Powers that use Intimacy or similar mechanics treat her two forms as separate
 people with separate relationships.
 Powers used to try and extract information about her, at best, treat her
 as two people with close ties to the same friend group.
 Even powers that read thoughts or emotions do not reveal thoughts more
 closely aligned to her Dream Form.

Flicker|(textbf

 In embracing their dreams, the Luminous find themselves adrift.
 The difference between the Dream Form and Mundane Form is as night and
 day; to act on the world through imagination one moment, and to be confined
 to one's the limits of flesh and blood the next.
 It's all easy to slip somewhere in between.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When a Luminous reverts to Mundane Form after transforming, she suffers
 Flicker.
 Until she has had the time to readjust to it, the habits and instinctual
 Weaving of her Dream Form make her seem more awkward, stilted and distracted.
 She suffers a penality equal to her Reverie divided by 3 (rounded up) to
 all actions taken in her Mundane Form.
 She gains a bonus on her Transformation rolls equal to that penalty.
 Once a scene, if she fails an important task or suffers significant social
 complications due to this, she gains a Beat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
If it was caused by transformation, the Flicker penality reduces by one
 every ten minutes.
 This duration increases to an hour (or a scene, whichever is shorter) if
 she has been transformed for a whole scene or longer, four hours (or two
 scenes) if she has been transformed for a day or longer, one day if she
 has been transformed for a week or longer, or one week if she has been
 transformed for a month or longer.
 If she transforms again while suffering Flicker, the duration continues
 accumulating as if she had never left her Dream Form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While she enters Dream Form when she dreams, this does not trigger Flicker
 until her Reverie increases to 6 or above.
 Afterwards, she suffers Flicker with an duration of one hour whenever she
 wakes.
 Track this Flicker seperately from Flicker from transformation.
 At Reverie 9 or above, her Flicker penalty can no longer be reduced below
 -2.

 Crossing the Sea of Stars, all the dreams of humanity join together and

 Though Luminous are at home in both the worlds it joins, their true origin
 lies among the stars.
 Their souls intertwine with the Sea's paths, dispersing into its flows.
 Resonance is a Luminou's innate power born of that intertwining, allowing
 them to feel the connections between worlds and people alike.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Dream reflects the wishes, feelings, impressions of the waking world
 at its surface.
 Every place is reflected in the dreams of someone, becoming its own place
 in a world of illusion and stories.
 Reflected across the Sea of Stars, a mall known for shootings and violence
 slowly twists into an warzone.
 A college known for its academic brilliance comes to become a larger-than-life
 monument to the gods of knowledge, and the school known for its restrictions
 and heavy-handed authority twists in the Dream such that classrooms seem
 more like jail cells than places of learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous are innately aware of this connection between worlds.
 On Earth, they always know the general feeling and mood of any location
 they enter.
 As a reflection of the Dream, this impression reflects more the accumulated
 impressions of people who frequent the area over the course of weeks, rather
 than simply those who are present in the moment.
 Those places where the Dream's reflection of a place begins to influence
 its origin back are especially distinct for a Luminous.
 They automatically sense that this is happening, and have a general idea
 of the stories and concepts that the Dream influences the waking world
 through.
 Similarly in the Dream, they are aware of the general circumstances in
 the real world that have created such an reflection in the Dream, and whether
 it is at risk of influencing the waking world in return.

Interwoven Dreams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Most dreamers never meet another, never finding the path from their own
 dreams into the Sea.
 That quiet wish for an escape, that wish that first led the Luminous to
 the Kingdoms still resonates with them after their Realization.
 Reaching out through their Resonance, their soul still years for the more
 distant dreams.
 Through it, they rewrite the Sea ever so slightly, drawing their own dreams
 closer to those of they already love, those they wish to know better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Their personal dreams become entwined with those they have at least Medium
 Intimacy with, catching glimpses of each other's inner depths that they
 would not normally see in their waking lives.
 Even if they rarely directly meet, the ideas and themes of their dreams
 still intermingle.
 At this level, both dreamers gain 9-Again on all rolls made to understand
 or emphasize with each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With Strong Intimacy, rather than simply sharing a dream world, they come
 to be parts of the same stories, seeing the same wonders and facing the
 same challenges together.
 The bonus from Medium Intimacy grants a rote quality instead of 9-Again,
 and both dreamers know by heart each other's Anchors and any similarly
 character defining traits such as Bans or a Mage's Obsessions.
 Furthermore, the Luminous may lead the other dreamer into the Kingdoms
 proper or other parts of the Astral Realms without the use of any powers
 or checks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At Connected Intimacy, the shared dreams grow ever more intense.
 Sometimes the dreamers dream as each other, as the same person, from each
 other's perspectives.
 Through that, they come to know the truth of each other's hearts.
 Both partners gain an automatic success on any rolls Strong Intimacy grants
 a bonus to.
 Unlike lower intimacy levels, this inherently breaches any protection Veiling
 and similar abilities provides.

The more Luminous try to help lessen the burdens of the mundane world, the
 more they find them inexorably tied with supernatural forces – often ones
 far over their heads to solve.
 It's natural them, that they often meet and become close to other kinds
 of supernatural beings.
 Their Resonance guides the way, granting them glimmers of insight to their
 inner world an outsider normally could never pierce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Through such shared dreams, a Luminous gains an intuitive understanding
 of what broadly drives any kind of supernatural creature she has Medium
 Intimacy with.
 At Strong Intimacy, she gains deeper insights into how they see the world
 and their place in it – especially when she draws on it herself through
 Reflected Light.
 At Connected Intimacy, her shared dreams shows her deeply and personally
 what it would be like to be...
 something else, had she been touched by a different force before her Realizatio
n.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous who have befriended another kind of supernatural being have a deeper

 outside the Dream.

 A Luminous' soul is entwined in the Sea, partly dispersed into its flows.
 Luminous may call upon that part of themselves to resist attempts to influence
 their mind or emotions, grounding themselves in a true self out of reach
 to most magic.
 They are always aware of such attempts to influence them and may spend
 Willpower on any roll to contest such effects or elect not to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When resisting supernatural influences in this way, the Luminous rolls a
 Clash of Wills versus the power with a dice pool of Reverie + Hope.
 If the power would change how she feels about one or more people she has
 a positive relationship with, she gains the highest Intimacy bonus among
 the people affected to her roll.
 However, this same protection can be turned against them.
 Should someone she has Intimacy with support the effort, or encourge her
 to fall into it (whether of their free will or otherwise), she suffers
 a penality to both her resistance roll against the ability and her Clash
 of Wills equal to their Intimacy bonus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When resisting extraordinary (but still mundane) means of mental influence
 such as drugs or advanced technology, she simply ignores the attempt.
 If she choses to do so, she immediately suffers Flicker as if she had transform
ed.
 This is not obviously a supernatural effect, and cannot be easily distinguished
 from the resistance of a particularly strong willed mortals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This power applies against effects that outright manipulate things such
 as her emotions, thought process, memory, relationships.
 More subtle effects such as illusions, those read her mind, or communicate
 information to her (even if it is distracting or false) do not trigger
 Dreamer's Will.
 However, it does still apply against powers that indirectly manipulate
 her such as those that work through manipulation of underlying reality
 or concepts.
 This is an active act of Dreamweaving and cannot be mistaken for any level
 of mortal resistance.

In a world of living dreams, to imagine a thing is the same as to do it.
 There are no law of physics to say that someone couldn't ride the winds
 through the sky, or dive into the deepest depths of the ocean.
 Nothing could clip those wings, short for the will of another dreamer.
 Without any laws of reality to bind them, the Dream could only ever be
 a reflection of all wishes of those souls within.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The art of Dreamweaving was born of that world.
 To weave together creativity and will, breathing life into colorful imagination
s and beautiful dreams.
 When cruel nightmares besieged the Kingdom, the Starborn could fight back
 with swords woven of courage and lances woven of fury.
 No matter how helpless they were when they awoke, they...
 for that moment, they could shine...

Every Luminous was once such a person, chasing after half-remembered memories
 of an impossible light.
 Holding it in their hands now...
 they come face to face with the hidden horrors and familiar cruelties of
 the world alike.
 This time, they need not only dream.

In a dream, the principles behind an action matter far more than knowing
 how to perform every little step.
 Those truly familiar with the Dream's flows may act directly through those
 principles, rather than translating their real world knowledge into their

A Weaving Skill represents how well a character understands the underlying
 principles that connect an entire category of actions.
 Any character with significant ties to the Dream (whether as natives, or
 Starborn) may purchase Weaving Skills in the same way as regular Skills.
 Characters attempting to use Weaving Skills untrained suffer a -3 penalty.
 This penalty is reduced to -1 for Luminous.

The Dream is woven of the light of all of humanity.
 Memories, emotion and stories melded together into a single unimaginable
 world.
 Through their Evocations, the Luminous draw a small thread of its light
 into the waking world, overturning its laws with those of the Dream.
 For an ephemeral moment, the stories and hope they see in their dreams
 may exist in their waking life too.
\end_layout

Even if they aren't truly real as the powers of other supernatural beings,
 those fleeting moments are all the Luminous need, in the end.

 when all is done.

 Stories bright enough to overturn the world's law for a moment, perhaps,
 but stories nevertheless.
 When they fade, all their direct disappear as if they were never cast.
 Videos of the magic fade as if nothing happened – leaving only the barest
 traces superimposed as if pasted on top to explain truly impossible actions.
 Even wounds and apparent death caused by a Luminous' magic fades like a
 dream when all is said and done.

An Evocation automatically fades at the end of the Scene in which it were
 cast, and may be ended prematurely by its caster by spending a Willpower.

\begin_layout Standard
Only a precious few of an Evocation's effects can remain when it ends.
 Memories of the event, and any mental changes created by them are not affected.
 Nor are effects wrought upon a Luminous' Dream Form or other Dreamborn
 – as they were never real in the first place.
 Otherwise, to make permanent changes, the Luminous must confirm her magic
 with mundane action – after all, those are still 
\emph on
real

 to the waking world, even if they were only possible because of an illusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though a Luminous couldn't simply banish toxins from the soil, she could
 collect them into a pool with her magic, then collect them in a bottle.
 She couldn't teleport the items out of a safe, but she could blow off the
 door and simply carry them off.
 And well...
 when words fail and fights break out, she may ensure her opponent stays
 dead as any mortal may.

With their Regalia, the Luminous weave superhuman abilities and touches
 of magic into their Dream Form.
 Even when they appear to be equipment and shining arms, a Luminous' Regalia
 are not truly separate from her.
 Her sword feels like as much part her as her lace wings, and she wields
 it with an almost surreal fluidity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the are extensions of her Dream Form, Regalia do not function for anyone
 other than the Luminous who summoned them, and dissolve into motes of light
 a short moment after they leave their presence.
 Disarming Luminous is rarely useful, as they may reflexively recall any
 Regalia they have lost on their turn at no cost.

Luminous may summon Regalia when she transforms into her Dream Form or as
 a reflective action at the start of each turn.
 Regalia each have a base effect, and multiple Upgrades or Variants.
 Upgrades enhance the base effect of the Regalia, and Variants replace it
 – hence, only one Variant may be used at a time.

Each Regalia costs a single Mote to summon, and a further Mote at the beginning

Effects:

 The Luminous splits her Dream Form into two bodies, dispersing her awareness

 This is disorienting and distracting to say the least, but she can often
 remain functional enough to at least get the job done.
 One of the bodies may be her Mundane Form, but this effect is only cosmetic.
 She is treated as if she were in Dream Form, albeit still with the protection
 of Dual Identity.
\end_layout

Both bodies share a single bar of Dream Health, and she may choose one of
 her bodies to return to when she reverts to Mundane Form for any reason.
 Regalia must be summoned independently for both bodies.

 Any participants who made statements of intent meant to convince another
 become a target of the Charm.
 If all participants are genuine and sincere in their intentions, the Charm
 binds them all magically to fulfill their own duties.
 Each participant replaces one of their Aspirations as if they had used
 Shining Vow themselves.
 If one or more of the participants do not intend to uphold their end of
 the oath, the Charm reveals their deception to all involved parties, and
 has no further effects.

 The Luminous joins herself to an Wyrd-bound Oath initialized by a Changeling
 or stranger being of Faerie.
 This uses the usual rules found on pages 212-214 of 
\emph on
Changeling: the Lost 2e
\emph default
.
 Luminous spend Motes instead of Glamour to seal such promises, and must
 draw those Motes from Hope instead of a Mote Pool.
 They may not initiate such Oaths without a Changeling's help – the normal
 powers of Shining Vow are the most they can do on their own.
