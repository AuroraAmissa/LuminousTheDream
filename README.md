Luminous: the Dream
===================

*Luminous: the Dream* is a [Chronicles of Darkness](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/)
fanwork inspired by both *Princess: the Hopeful* and *Changeling: the Dreaming*. Luminous are heroes that draw on the
power of their dreams to fight against the darkness that lurks in the waking world and world of dreams alike. Of
course, that makes them *magical girls*.

A rendered copy of the current version of Luminous may be found on
[Github](https://github.com/AuroraAmissa/LuminousTheDream/releases).

Repo Setup
----------

Run `scripts/init.sh` on Linux after cloning the repository.

Rendering
---------

Luminous is typeset using the [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) document processor. It uses the
[XeLaTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) rendering engine. This repository should contain everything you need to render
it, as long as you have the needed software.

To render it, you will need to install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and then install
[Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/Download#toc3). 

Note that it (optionally) uses the `gitinfo2` package to embed revision information into the output PDF. Use a
`git config --local core.hooksPath RulebookShared/hooks` command if you want to enable this for your copy.

Building a Release
------------------

Release packages can only be built on Linux using the [Nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager. Install nix, and use the scripts in
`scripts/*`. As a quick reference:

* `build.sh` - Builds the distribution release you normally download.
* `clean.sh` - Removes all files generated by the build script.
* `init.sh` - Initializes the repository after the initial checkout.
