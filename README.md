Luminous: the Dream
===================

*Luminous: the Dream* is a [Chronicles of Darkness] fanwork inspired by both *Princess: the Hopeful* and *Changeling:
the Dreaming*. Luminous are heroes that draw on the power of their dreams to fight against the darkness that lurks in
the waking world and world of dreams alike. Of course, that makes them *magical girls*.

A rendered copy of the current version of Luminous may be found on [Github].

Rendering
---------

Luminous is typeset using [LuaLaTeX]. This repository should contain everything you need to render it, as long as
you have the needed software. You will need to install [TeX Live] and the [Nix] package manager.

Use the `./build.sh draft` command to render a draft document.

Unfortunately, it can currently only be built on Linux for technical reasons. Please use [WSL2] to render Luminous
on Windows. Feel free to ask for help in the [Discord server].
