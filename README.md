Luminous: the Dream
===================

*Luminous: the Dream* is a [Chronicles of Darkness](http://theonyxpath.com/category/worlds/chroniclesofdarkness/) fanwork inspired by both *Princess: the Hopeful* and *Changeling: the Dreaming*. It's about magical girls. It's fun, and still very much in progress.

A rendered copy of the current version of Luminous may be found on [my website](https://lymia.moe/jenkins/job/LuminousTheDream/).

Rendering
---------

Luminous is typeset using the [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/) document processor. It uses the [XeLaTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) rendering engine. This repository should contain everything you need to render it, as long as you have the needed software.

On Windows, install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and then install [Lyx](https://www.lyx.org/Download#toc3).

On Arch Linux, it requires the following packages: `lyx texlive texlive-latexextra`.

Note that it (optionally) uses the `gitinfo2` package to embed revision information into the output PDF. Use a `git config --local core.hooksPath hooks` command if you want to enable this for your copy.
