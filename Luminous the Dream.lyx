 this document, and the commands that the build_*.sh scripts use to define
 settings for the build script.

 inelegant, but I couldn't think of better.

Luminous: the Dream
\shape default
 is a fanmade roleplaying game for the Chronicles of Darkness, published
 by White Wolf Publishing.
 Players take on the role of magical girls or boys who dream of a better
 future for all.
 Who found themselves wielding the power of dreams against malign magical
 forces and the mundane cruelties of the world alike.
 Because they know they can make a difference.
 And as long as they can make a difference, they couldn't forgive themselves
 if they didn't at least try.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This version of Luminous: the Dream contains author commentary (from AuroraAmiss
a).
 This is mainly meant to help explain how various design decisions in this
 fansplat came about, and thus help people writing general CofD fansplats
 or addons for Luminous to better understand the themes and subtler points
 of the system's design.
 As a bonus, if you're a Storyteller, it'll probably give you quite a bit
 of insight into how to run the game that I can't easily write into the

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Boxes in this color are said personal commentary, and do not exist in the
 normal copies of this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I saw a lot of the D&D/Pathfinder homebrew on the Giant in the Playground
 forums use collapsible for a similar purpose, and I found the insights
 there so valuable.
 Similarly, Mark Rosewater's own blog on the design of Magic: the Gathering
 and its mechanics were invaluable in my own personal growth as a game designer.
 The community of fan set authors that built around it was equally amazing.
 In a sense, this version of Luminous is my way to pass on that legacy to
 a different community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is...
 very much a passion project for me, born out of loving so much of Princess:
 the Hopeful, and yet seeing so much of its flaws just lurking under the
 surface.
 In many ways, it is a return to the original pitch by Cruton, before Princess
 was touched by so many other hands.
 So perhaps I should say this is a fork of Princess: the Fading, not Hopeful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In my opinion, Princess became 
\emph on
diluted
\emph default
 over its development process, its themes lost when it was touched by so
 many different people with so many different opinions.
 Some people were afraid it was too like Changeling: the Dreaming, and tried
 to distinguish it.
 Others had different ideas as to how dark Princess should be, how light
 it could be without contradicting the World of Darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous refines the themes of Princess, casting the Dream as the very heart
 of what magical girls are.
 In Luminous, magical girls are those who cannot stand the shadows of the
 world and cannot let go of the dreams they first saw in their childhood.
 For them, the Dream is a source of all their power, not simply some Trap.
 In that sense, it embraces the comparison to Changeling: the Dreaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the process, it discards many of the themes that made up the Darkness
 in Princess.
 The dark forces that eat away at the heart of humanity, the struggle against
 an seemingly overwhelming opponent — in favor of far more human 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

main
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 antagonists.
 Another homebrew author, MushroomBadger, has taken up those themes at the
 heart of their own fork of Princess – Beloved: the Promise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Both of us, in some way, came to the same conclusion independently – Something
 of Princess has to be cut for its themes to come together.
 I chose to make the Dream central, and MushroomBadger choose to cut the
 Dreamlands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Princess is an amazing game despite all its flaws, one that brought the
 possibility of World of Darkness fanworks on this scale to the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

popular consciousness
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

.
 For those who want to do better, it also serves as a lesson.
 The first of them is...
 that themes are at the heart of every Chronicles of Darkness game, not
 ideas, or mechanics.
 A great idea that contradicts the rest of your work will bring it all down,
 not add to it.
 Design is about what you cut, not what you do.

Over time,

Changeling: the Dreaming

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
Once you were young.
 No matter how old we may be, all of us were once young.
 We looked at the world through truly fresh eyes, felt it as fully and intensely
 as anyone ever could.
 When we loved, it was the happiest days we had ever known.
 When we were hurt, it was the greatest tragedy we had ever felt.
 And the world shined with possibility.
 We all thought we had a way to change the world, embracing it with all
 our hearts.
 We looked to our heroes and told ourselves "I can do that too".
 It seemed that if only we were given our chance, we could make the world
 better.
 That the pains of the world we felt so strongly were something we could
 overcome...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
...
 we believed.
 We all once believed.
 And yet, when you look at the world around you today...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
One day, you saw a man huddling in a corner, covered in all too old rags
 when you came out of the supermarket.
 So many people passed him, looking at him sadly then turning away.
 You could see the desperation on his face.
 You couldn't bear it...
 You give him what cash you had, and a change of clothes.
 It wasn't enough.
 You knew it wasn't enough...
 Not if you were the only one helping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
That night, you confided in your old friend from kindergarten.
 Who you had always relied on, who had always stood by your side back then.
 ...
 and yet, this time, she frowned.
 She asked you if you really thought that money would really change anything,
 or if he would just use it to buy beer.
 She told you she was worried about how you would live through college if
 you kept doing this.
 She told you that you should let people like that go.
 That night, you cried yourself to sleep.
 Why couldn't you just be like them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
One day, you told your parents that you wanted to be a writer instead of
 a doctor.
 They told you that you didn't really want that.
 That you wouldn't ever be popular anyway, and you'd be starving on the
 street.
 They told you that if you threw away your life like that, they wouldn't
 help you anymore.
 They told you to stop being stuck in a dream.
 You weren't sure what else you expected...
 everywhere you went, there were so many people who had given up on hoping
 so long ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
At least, this time was different.
 That night, you logged into the same chat room you found a few weeks ago.
 One full of people who understand your pains.
 They got it.
 They also still believed.
 They also still dreamed.
 And they comforted you.
 Showed you a way forward.
 Reassured you in the path you chose...
 They told you that it was okay to be you.
 This time, you had less reason to cry.
 Even if you still did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
One day, you saw a boy crying in the toy aisle, clinging tightly to a stuffed
 animal he wanted.
 But his parents wouldn't have any of that.
 Because boys weren't supposed to like things like that.
 Because boys weren't supposed to cry.
 Because that is not how the world was supposed to be.
 And so many onlookers walked by, even watched with sneers on their faces.
 You couldn't tell who they even were sneering at, the mother or you.
 It didn't matter.
 Nobody helped.
 Nobody else helped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
...
 but you tried anyway.
 Even as they dragged him away as they called you terrible names.
 He wasn't crying as much anymore.
 ...
 maybe, just maybe.
 You showed him that he wasn't alone in the world.
 Just like your friends once did for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
You never could give up, no matter how hard you tried.
 No matter how much everyone around you told you to save yourself, that
 you were naive and only hurting yourself.
 You couldn't stop caring.
 You couldn't stop believing.
 You couldn't stop trying.
 You couldn't forgive yourself if you did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
And that...
 is what makes you a Luminous.
 Not the shining magic you wield, but the simple fact you could never stop
 dreaming of a better world.

Luminous: the Dream
\emph default
 is a game about those who dream of a better future inspired by the 
\shape italic
mahou shoujo
\shape default
 (or magical girl) genre of Japanese anime and manga.
 It is set in the Chronicles of Darkness, a world much like our own only
 touched by alien wonders and terrors alike.
 This story is not truly about those horrors.
 It is about humanity, and the one power we can truly call our own.
 Our shining will to change the world.
 A will that blossomed into a force that could only be called magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this game, you play a Luminous, one of the shining souls that wields
 the power of the Dream.
 Those like you were hidden, shining dimly through so much of history.
 ...
 but shine they did.
 Writing into the untold margins of history, they built the legacy you now
 inherent.
 When you Blossomed, you awoke to the world of dreams they hid deep beyond

It will not be easy.
 The world has always been an unkind place.
 Generations of darkness scar the heart of humanity.
 So many people are afraid to dream, and so focus on preserving what they
 already have.
 So many people are scared that any change to the world would crumble it
 all down, and hence fear those who dream brightly.
 Some people once dreamed, and had them broken by those who were scared
 in just the same way.

Glimmers of light shine through that long and dark night.
 We had created so many wonders over the generations, and they simply accumulate.

 before.
 For the first time, people could see that nobody is truly alone.

At its heart,

Luminous: the Dream

 is about the contrast between dreams and idealism vs the harshness of realities
 and the necessities of survival.
 A Luminous may dream of a better world, that they know may one day be true.
 She may defeat the monster on her own.
 Maybe even she could be elected, help guide the city council towards reform.
 She can rescue the boy she loves.
\end_layout

But even with their shining magic, they may only do so much on their own.
 They can only win when a hundred million small victories one day add up

Distant Legacies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of the powers of the Luminous or the Maou who oppose to them were given
 to them.
 They were built over the generations out of necessity, shaped by the ideas
 of the time.
 There was a time before the Luminous knew how to veil their two forms in
 a Dual Identity.
 There was a time long long ago where the Luminous and the Maou considered
 each other the same thing.
 The scars and powers of those ages still remain to this day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just the same as for mundane humanity.
 The technologies we rely on, that connect so many Luminous to each other
 were built on ages of advancements and discoveries.
 The pains that haunt the Luminous and those they love are echoes of traumas
 from generations past.
 The story of the Willful and humanity are mirrors of each other, down to
 the last...
\end_layout

Luminous is a story about humanity, its past and its future.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Changelings are those who were hurt and traumatized, and rely on each other.
 After all, the broader world doesn't understand such things, blame things
 they can't control on them.
 Vampires are less of a metaphor for anything in reality, but no less an
 outsider story – literally waking only when most people sleep.
 Demons and Prometheans are those who were never human, but seek to be –
 both in their own ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Luminous aren't much different.
 They dream too brightly for the World of Darkness, hope for too much.
 Normally voices like theirs are snuffed out, by people who care too much
 to just sit by as they watch their dreams destroy them.
 People are jealous, or fearful of those who want to change the world for
 the better.
 ...
 and they are all too willing to accept cruelties those as empathetic as
 the Luminous simply can't.

Perhaps for the first time in history, the Luminous see a way they can win.
 The world stands on a precipice that cannot be backed away from.
 The same technologies and ideas that entrench the fears and greed of those
 in power empower those who hope.
 In today's world, the Hopeful can come together in a way they never had
 been able to before and Blossom in numbers not heard of since the heights

The World of Darkness is traditionally stories of survival.
 Luminous is not.

 from the cruelties of those who don't care, the scars of generations of
 pain.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different story from the popular original, Magia Record’s focus pivoted
 more to the human response to the woes of magic in a dark world.
 It focuses on relationships, girls pulling each other from the brink of
 despair, and standing up for what’s right.
 With many side-stories in the original phone game, it showcased slice-of-life
 episodes that brought attention to the bonds needed to survive being a
 magical girl.

 is underlined with themes of heartfelt communication between people who
 otherwise misunderstand each other, determination to protect, and what
 we sacrifice in order to protect.
 The main character, Hibiki, embodies much of what the Luminous stand for,
 with her belief in the ability to reach to the heart, and the refusal to
 give up in the heart of darkness, whether it be in actual battle or peoples
 own despair.
 Each member of the main cast suffers tragedy, and it’s through their bonds
 with others that they’re able to stand up again.

 It shows that growing up doesn’t mean that the things you believed in when
 younger have to be forgotten and let go of.
 It tells of how even in a darker world, hoping is not in vain.
 The movie shows the world like the Luminous see it; almost everyone else
 loses their flame, their light, their hope in the world, because they believe
 it’s the only way to survive.
 But it isn't true.
 The song Everything’s Not Awesome summarizes it all fairly well.

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous built the Dream they draw their magic from over the generations,
 hiding it away in the edges of their dreams, in a place where the dreams
 of humanity naturally bleed together.
 Their nature is as fluid and shifting as any other dream.
 Before the Luminous were magical girls, they were the paladins in shining
 armor, the angels with wings of light, the witch in the forest, the village
 shaman.
 All dreaming of a better world, where they and those they love could simply
 live happily.
\end_layout

In the moment they Blossom, they shape their soul into a world they call

The Dream the Luminous visit in their sleep and draw their power from is
 itself a true world, if one built out of stories and feelings rather than
 the matter and physics of the real world.
 In that world of dreams, they wove eight Kingdoms of Light over the years,
 dream-like visions of what the world could be some day in the future.
 Those visions shape the Invocations the Nobles use to shape their magic,
 written by like-minded Luminous over the generations and preserved in the
 depths of the Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kingdom is not quite like the Luminary or Archetype of a Luminous.
 Rather than being a part of their Dreamscape, it is rather the physical
 location their Dreamscape resides in.
 Whether its Threshold appears as a mansion in a major city or an out-of-the-way
 hollow in an unsuspecting tree, its physical presence in the Kingdom itself
 is what defines a Noble unambiguously as a member of it.

The Luminous Y-Splat.
 It's ultimately not too different from Princess' Courts, but without the

I feel Twilight Courts were one of the bigger mistakes of Princess.
 They were extreme (or otherwise tainted) versions of perfectly workable
 worldviews, and almost seemed to present those worldviews as necessarily

 Most of these Kingdoms are modified from P:tH's courts, modified to be
 more comprehensive and less...

 Its cities strongly resemble modern civilization, but in a way that highlights

\begin_layout Standard
Above all else, Muirias brings together those Luminous where people value
 knowledge, without losing sight of the fundamental wonder and curiosity
 that drives people to discover.
 To them, to reduce the world to what is physically true is to rob it of
 the magic that drives that curiosity forward.
 The marvels of the world cannot be seen simply through textbooks and rote
 memorization.
 So many meaningful truths can only be learned when you experience them
 for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you understand well enough the truth behind those wonders and what
 makes them wonderful, then you can weave your own.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Society's greatest achievements were always made when we learned more of

Invocation: Brillare 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Brillare is born of the joys of learning, of childlike curiosity and wonder
 at the world.
 It encourages one to always seek to know the world better, and reach for
 the unknown rather than fearing it.
 Those who resonate with Brilliare are charged to reveal the secrets that
 made the world dark for so long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Free Invocation:
\series default
 Brillare applies at no cost when the Princess intends to discover a new
 truth not known to the Luminous, to teach others something new to them,
 or when correcting those who were deceived by others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Ban:
\series default
 Those who make use of Brillare should want to know, to teach and bring
 together.
 A Luminous who attempts to deceive someone unopposed to herself or her
 allies for no good cause, helps another to do so, or runs from the unknown
 rather than seeking to discover its truth may not apply the Invocation
 until the next dawn.
 Simple selfish gain is not enough reason to deceive another to Muirias,
 it must be to protect the privacy or secrecy of another or to prevent harm
 to another.

Character Creation|textbf

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step One: Character Concept 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin creating a Luminous, come up with a rough idea of who you want
 to play.
 What kind of upbringing did she have? What kind of experiences, good or
 bad, did she have growing up? What does she think of the world around her?
 What does she want to see the world become? What has she experienced to
 lead her to want to change the world? What led up to her Blossoming, if
 it happened before the game starts?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't worry too much about details like Invocations yet.
 Instead, try to figure out who your character is inside, how they think
 and feel, and who they see themselves as.
 From that, distill it into a simple core concept like "young politician"
 or "aspiring writer".
 As you go through the character creation process, you can always fall back
 on this initial seed and do whatever feels right given it or adjust it
 if you think something else would fit her just a slight bit better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Aspirations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, choose your character's Aspirations.
 Hopeful have two more aspirations than usual, for a total of five.
 Two of them must be related to the supernatural world, or her Dream Form.
 What does she want to do to make the world a better place? What supernatural
 creatures has she run into before, and what does she like to do with them?
 Has she run into any supernatural problems she wants to solve?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, two of her aspirations must relate to her mundane life, or
 at least the mundane world.
 Does she have friends she made a promise to? Does she have an internet
 community to run? What is her school life like, and is there something
 she would especially like to accomplish there?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of your Aspirations should be short term goals that can be completed
 in a session or two, and at least one should be a longer-term goal that
 may take a whole Chapter to complete.
 Aspirations are one of the main ways you earn beats, which advance your
 character.
 They help the Storyteller know where you want to go with your character,
 and what kinds of stories you want them to experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Two: Select Attributes 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "Sec-AttributeSelection"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dream Attributes
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Attributes are the innate characteristics of your character, such as how
 fast, charismatic or smart she is.
 When choosing your attributes, ask yourself what would lead your character
 to lead to her living the life she does, what she would choose to develop,
 what skills she relies on, and whether she uses her magic or mundane skills
 to achieve her goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous and characters who are intended to Blossom in play do not choose
 their attributes like most characters.
 Begin by assign dots to her three 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
hyperref[Sec-TransformedAttrs]{dream attributes}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Begin with 1 dot in each dream attribute, then assign 8 dots between then,
 up to a maximum of 6 dots in any attribute.
 Then, beginning with 1 dot in each mundane attribute, distribute 12 dots
 between your character's mundane attributes up to a maximum of 5 dots in
 any attribute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of your character's mundane attributes may exceed their corresponding
 dream attribute and you may not assign more than 5 dots to each of the
 mundane attribute categories (Physical, Mental and Social).
 If the highest mundane attribute corresponding to a dream attribute is
 lower than the amount you assigned earlier, gain the remainder as dream
 attribute dots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Commentary

I decided I should, in the end, to avoid making people feel like they have
 to optimize to make their Luminous character 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 Since they have a fixed total of both mundane and transformed dots, there's
 no real question of optimizing/gaming the best-of-three rules.
 To avoid it being too complicated and mathy for most players to work out,
 this pretty much removes attribute category prioritization.

Step Three: Select Skills 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Weaving Skills
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Next, choose your character's Skills.
 They reflect the more specific skills she has gained over her life rather
 than her innate traits.
 When choosing Skills, think about your character's background.
 What had she studied during school? What are her hobbies?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assign her skills using the same process as her attributes, except skills
 begin at 0 dots instead of 1 dot.
 Assign 15 dots between her 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
hyperref[Sec-TransformedSkills]{Weaving Skills}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, then assign 22 dots between her mundane skills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with attributes, none of your character's mundane skills may exceed the
 corresponding Weaving Skill, and you may not assign more than 11 dots to
 any of the mundane skill categories.
 If the highest mundane skill corresponding to a Weaving skill is lower
 than the amount you assigned earlier, gain the remainder as Weaving skill
 dots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Four: Skill Specialties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You start with three Skill Specialties, representing your character's particular
 field of competence in a given skill, as opposed to the broader competence
 Skill dots represent.
 You write your own Skill Specialties, reflecting where your character truly
 shines in their broader field.
 For example, a character may have specialty in Poetry for the Expression
 skill.
 As usual, this is a chance to refine your idea of who your character is,
 as much as a chance to express it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Five: Add Luminous Template 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, you're ready to deal with the more magical aspects of your
 character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Luminary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she Blossoms, a Luminous builds her Dream Form from the symbols of
 the Dream.
 The first of these is her 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

, the celestial light she patterns her magic after.
 It forms the basis of how she uses her magic, and decides which of the
 three powers of the Luminous she focuses on.
 Read over the three Luminaries you may pick (Sunlight, Moonlight and Starlight)
, and choose the one that fits your character concept the best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may well be that your character could fit into multiple Luminaries.
 Often, such characters tend to have the Luminary that reflects the kind
 of power they would be more comfortable wielding, if their personality
 could go either way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Archetype 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether your character would be a shining hero, an idol whose songs change
 the world, or a shrine maiden that upholds the boundary between worlds,
 she is yet still a Luminous.
 The Luminous have taken on many forms and roles over their long history,
 after all.
 Her Archetype reflects which of those legacies she would wish to continue
 on, and the overall form and concept of her Dream Form.
 Read over the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 They draw power from their Kingdoms, invoking the principles and feelings
 that underlie them through their Invocations.
 Read over the Kingdoms and choose the one that your character would most
 believe in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dream & Will
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose your character's Dream and Will.
 While most mortals have a Virtue and a Vice, Luminous draw their strength
 from their dearest dreams and shining will.
 Her Dream is the ideal world she would wish to live in, far in the distant
 future.
 It is the hope she clings to when she needs reminding what she is fighting
 for, and the world she dreams of in her sleep.
 Her Will is the means by which she changes the world, and interacts with
 it.
 It is the part of herself she draws on to face the challenges the world
 bring against her, how she connects with a world that seems far too foreign
 to her.

 Kingdom had built over the long years for themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Luminous starts with three dots in Invocations, one of which must be

 When a Luminous Blossoms, the first part of the world she changes is herself.
 In her nascent Dreamscape, she weaves an image of her world into her very
 soul.
 While she doesn't truly lose her mortal Virtues and Vices, they no longer
 anchor her well enough against her own dreams, nor the world's pressures.
 Rather, she learns to draw on that image of a better world, and the means
 by which she knows she can touch the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her vision of her ideal world is called her Dream.
 It is the one possible future out of endless possibilities that she considers

 A Hopeful who Dreams of "Among the Stars" may draw on the magic of Muirias,
 but that world is ultimately a kind of compromise.
 Unfettered by such things, they would dream of a world where all have a
 place among the countless stars, each planet holding its own form of utopia.
 When a Luminous takes a risk to make their Dream a reality, she regains
 one Willpower.
 When a Luminous makes noticeable progress in realizing that Dream for herself
 or the broader world, she regains all Willpower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The means by which she knows she can change the world is called her Will.
 Even if she has many talents, it is the one she holds closest to her heart,
 the thing she falls back on when everything else fails.
 A Dreamer who writes for a newspaper in her waking life may have a Will

The Hopeful draw on the external world, as much as they rely on their inner

 Nobody can just fight their whole life without...

 Not alone, not without something to hold themselves steady.

Sometimes, those remainders are the people she have helped in life and now

 Sometimes, it's her family of choice and close friends who once rescued

 world has always had.
 Whatever form it takes, a Luminous' Touchstones are the things the Luminous

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous live in a world slowly falling to cold and unfeeling systems
 and processes.
 In their sleep, they dream of the futures the world is too scared to accept.
 In the waking world, they wield that shining magic, channeling their most
 dear dreams into the world – if only for a moment – through their force
 of will.

The Luminous learn to draw the Dream into reality, suspending the laws of
 the waking world just long enough to make a difference.
 Still, there is always a disconnect between what they can dream, and what
 they can actually do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Reverie measures how strongly she may connect the waking world
 and the Dream.
 As it increases, she is able to have higher traits in Dream Form, maintain
 more Regalia at once, spend more Motes without cost each turn, and deepens
 her natural empathic abilities.
 However...
 it doesn't come without downsides.
 As her power grows she also acclimates to the ways of the Dream, and adjusting
 back to her Mundane Form becomes increasingly difficult.

Motes are the small shards of the Dream's power that a Hopeful draws on
 to fuel her magic.
 She does not need to gather it from an outside source, but rather simply
 draws them from deep within her soul.
 She has a Mote Pool which refills to its capacity at the beginning of every
 scene.
 Beyond that, she can draw on her own emotional strength to fuel her magic.
 For every Mote she draws beyond her Mote Pool, she takes a box of mild
 Hope damage, leaving her feeling down and exhausted until she has time
 to recover.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Luminous' supernatural fuel isn't Motes.
 It's Hope.
 Hope serves as both a Clarity-like Integrity mechanic, and a Luminous'
 supernatural fuel.
 However, the idea of Motes gives me to name what you pay when you use your
 magic (saying Hope directly sounds...
 wrong in its implications).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The refilling Mote Pool, then, mitigates you casting from Integrity just
 a little.
 It also serves a secondary purpose of encouraging Luminous to use small
 amounts of magic often – magical girls solving relatively trivial issues
 with magic tends to be a common theme in any show that doesn't make a point
 about using magic responsibly.

The ideals of each of the Dream Kingdoms resonate throughout the Dream,

 Learning an Invocation allows a Luminous to draw on the pooled knowledge
 and magical skills that like-minded Luminous left behind generations ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous may have up to 5 dots in each Invocation.
 Each Invocation is described under the Kingdom that favors them, and Luminous
 of that Kingdom find that Invocation easiest to learn.
 They reflect a worldview as much as a source of power.
 While a Luminous may use the Invocations of Kingdoms she does not agree
 with, she does not grasp their logic or concepts intuitively and must be
 taught them by someone who already understand their principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a guideline, a Luminous who agrees at least partly with an Kingdom's
 beliefs may intuitively learn its Invocation up to three dots without a
 teacher.
 A Luminous who agrees with all its beliefs in at least vague terms (or
 is a member of the Kingdom) may learn all five dots of it intuitively.

Beyond that, the dot rating of Invocations are only used as dice pools for
 Clash of Wills in Luminous.
 Rather, they unlock upgrades to Regalia/Charms and let you do more with
 your Domains.
 Since those upgrades are free, unlike in P:tH, spending experiences on
 Invocations increases the power level of your character directly – and
 in an interesting way.

 Luminous magic is roughly divided into three major categories: Regalia,
 Domains and Charms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Regalia are the most physical embodiments of a Luminous' power.
 They are the radiant auras and weapons she summons in their Dream Form
 to fight or solve the kinds of problems that require a more direct approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Hopeful's Domains are the elements and concepts that resonate with her
 Invocations and her own dream.
 They are the power that defines the Luminous as fundamentally magical in
 the way they so often seem to be, allowing them to wield the elements as
 naturally as they move their own body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Charms are the more specialized powers of the Luminous, specific spells
 that allow them to touch upon the more esoteric mysteries of the world
 – or perhaps even create some of those mysteries themselves.

The three different power categories makes it easier for me to formalize
 different mechanics and roles for each.
 From a design perspective, the difference is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Regalia are equipment and passive effects that improve the Luminous.
 They are the closest a Luminous has to passive abilities, that make them
 better by just having them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Domains are things that shape the world directly, in freeform ways more
 like Influences than anything else.
 They are used often, but are still active, not passive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Charms are powerful but narrower abilities that give the Luminous things
 that feel like powerful

 They are the most active of their powers, requiring very explicit casting.

Shining Heart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Far too often, Luminous find themselves wanting to change the world when
 they personally experience the cruelties of the world.
 They cannot help but feel the pains of those around them, and even if they
 escape the worst of it personally, they almost certainly grow close to
 someone who suffers from it for one reason or another.
 They are themselves hurt by a world that tells them they are naive to hope,
 and a thousand times again when they see the pain reflected in another.

Sensitivity|(textbf
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A Luminous' strong emotions combined with their natural concern for others
 meld together into a deep empathy they call "Sensitivity", only growing
 stronger from their magic to connect hearts.
 Sensitivity is a dice pool equal to half the Hopeful's Reverie rounded
 up.
 Merits and other abilities may add additional dice to this pool, and non-Lumino
us may gain Sensitivity dice through merits or other traits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The kind of strong empathy that Sensitivity reflects isn't just an magical
 ailment/drawback as Princess' writing implies.
 It's what makes them Blossom in the first place.
 I've kept this mechanic because it's so appropriate to the core of what
 magical girls do.
 The mundane merit version of it is to try and reinforce this point.
 All of a Luminous' supernatural empathy is their Echo, not Sensitivity.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Take their Hand 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As much as the pains of others hurt them too, the Luminous can at least
 put it to good use.
 The level of connection they can have makes it easier for them to comfort
 and understand others.
 Sensitivity provides the following bonuses:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You add your Sensitivity as a bonus to mundane Empathy or any Resonate rolls
 to understand how someone feels, comfort them, or assure them of their
 own worth and value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may attempt to comfort someone facing a breaking point, reassuring them
 that at the very least, they are not alone.
 Roll Presence + Sensitivity.
 Take Hope damage equal to your number of successes, and add that many dice
 as a bonus to your target's roll.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you participate in a character recovering Hope damage, you may add
 your Sensitivity to the amount of mild Hope damage healed.
 Alternatively, you may roll Sensitivity to heal a box of mild Hope damage
 or reduce a box of severe Hope damage to mild for each success you roll.
 A character can benefit from this ability only once a day.

A Luminous fuels her power with the strength of her emotions, and far too

 She cannot help but feel an echo of the emotional pain those who are suffering
 feels, even as she does her best to help those around her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a Hopeful witnesses or learns about a situation that caused someone
 significant emotional pain, she takes a mild Hope attack with dice equal

 Deliberate acts of cruelty add a dice to this attack, and particularly
 heinous acts (such as prolonged deliberate torture) may add up to three
 dice, or add the Rote Quality in extreme cases.
\end_layout

Afterwards, she may immediately replace a short-term aspiration with one

 When she completes such an Aspiration, she gains an additional beat and

 If the Aspiration was a Long-Term Aspiration, she recovers all mild Hope
 damage instead.

Hope Damage and Recovery 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events that shake a Hopeful's resolve or strain her emotions cause her to
 suffer an attack against her Hope.
 She may take two kinds of Hope damage as a result.
 Mild Hope damage represents simpler emotional strain from her overexerting
 her magic or simply the weight of life bearing down on her without a release.
 Severe Hope damage represents fundamentally deeper pains that linger, even
 when the situation clears up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time a Luminous takes Hope damage, mark it off her Hope track using
 a slash (/) for mild damage and an (X) for severe damage.
 Mark mild damage in the leftmost empty box of her Hope track, and severe
 damage in the leftmost empty box or the leftmost box that is marked with
 only mild damage.
 Whenever a Princess takes mild Hope damage when her rightmost Hope box
 is filled, she instead takes a point of severe Hope damage.

A subtle mechanic, and one that serves a lot of purposes.
 Hope is a pretty mild mechanic as long as you keep damage low.
 But emotional strain has a way of spiraling, and the Hope mechanic reflects
 that.
 Since the dice pool for recovering Hope is remaining Hope, you simply 
\emph on
can't

 heal any more on your own once you have no remaining undamaged boxes.
 You have to rely on your Touchstones to pull you out of such a state.

Finally, this is the keystone that encourages Luminous to have some kind
 of a mundane life.
 Hope recovery is slow and takes time – they thrive in situations where
 they can live a quieter life, and keep their magical work somewhat separate
 from it.
 They can't easily handle having no time to rest, when the supernatural
 follows them home.
 Thus, Dual Identity and maintaining that secrecy becomes all the more important
 for them.

Dream Form protects a Luminous from physical harm, replacing her body with
 an illusion woven of the stuff of dreams.
 She has a separate health track called Dream Health, with boxes equal to
 her Resistance + transformed attribute cap.
 It serves as her health track for all purposes in Dream Form.
 She may transform reflexively in response to damage, in which case the
 damage is dealt to her Dream Health.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dream Health is more her will to not be hurt manifest physically than a
 measure of her body's physical integrity, and thus Luminous are often far
 more resilient than their delicate appearances may imply.
 In Dream Form, she does not suffer wound penalties and physical attacks
 against her are reduced in one level of severity – from aggravated to lethal,
 or lethal to bashing.
 Without supernatural force to convey it, her opponent cannot truly contest
 the Luminous' will directly and struggles to hurt her in a meaningful way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, aggravated damage against her Dream Form disrupts her mental balance
 in addition to its usual harm.
 She takes a box of mild Hope damage for every box of aggravated damage
 she receives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of her current from, a Luminous heals all damage to her Dream
 Health whenever she would recover Willpower from sleeping.
 Furthermore, every 15 minutes out of combat, she recovers one box of bashing
 damage or reduces a box of lethal damage to bashing damage.
 Should the rightmost box of her Dream Health be filled with lethal or aggravate
d damage, she immediately reverts to her Mundane Form and gains the Soul
 Shocked condition.

To the Luminous, walking by putting one foot in front of the other feels
 the same as simply imagining moving forward.
 There is no hard line between jumping onto their bed, or imagining an gravity
 defying leap between roofs.
 Luminous are caught between dreams and reality in their Dream Form, and
 they may draw on that to touch the world in all the ways they could in
 a dream.
 Whether they move or only imagine doing so, it still happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Luminous acts upon the world through imagination and thought, she
 performs a Weaving Action.
 Instead of rolling a dice pool using a normal skill, she uses a different
 set of eight Weaving Skills.
 Weaving is as natural to a Luminous as any other action, and thus has no
 cost.
 As such, they may reflexively roll any dice pool as a Weaving Action, even
 when contesting rolls or for rolls caused by hostile magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Weaving isn't blatantly supernatural, the surreal ways it touches
 the world are still not subtle.
 A Luminous defies gravity, the motion of her feet doesn't quite line up

Another of the things that defines the feel of Luminous.
 They don't interact with the world as mortals or even most supernatural
 beings do.
 To them, they move by intent as in a dream.
 Imagine moving in impossible ways and simply doing so.
 Strange body plans and unfamiliar body parts don't phase them the slightest
 – before they learn how to control them physically they can simply Weave
 their way through the adjustment period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Mechanically, this serves as one of their major advantages.
 They have higher dice pools on average between Dream Attributes and Weaving
 Actions.
 In fact, this replaces the normal supernatural trait added to supernatural
 powers.
 Since this gives them larger dice pools already, it's not entirely necessary
 for the Luminous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This also is meant as a partial patch to the problem some supernatural splats
 have that...
 powers require very specific Skills, limiting builds in a strange way.
 Why does a Changeling who lives in a city with no wilderness for ages have
 a Survival skill? Especially when its entire purpose is to cast Elemental
 Weapon? Because Luminous powers always use Weaving Skills, this problem
 is far lessened.

The Hopeful derive one last benefit from their transformation: Their mundane
 and dream forms appear to be two different people.
 Regardless of how similar her two forms look, others around her treat them
 as if they had entirely different appearances.
 This is not exactly an illusion, as it does not change what people see.
 Rather, it simply prevents them from recognizing the two forms as the same
 based on such.
 This protection extends to magical senses such as a Vampire's taste for
 blood, or an Uratha's ability to track others by scent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supernatural powers used to try and link her two identities are similarly
 fooled.
 Powers that use Sympathy or Intimacy treat her two forms as separate –
 a friend who only knows her in her mundane form has no Sympathy with her
 Dream Form.
 Powers that determine information about a Luminous do not directly reveal
 information that connect her two identities, treating her (at best) as
 two people with close ties to the same friend group.
 That may still break her cover in the context of a full investigation,
 of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As powerful as it is, however, a Luminous cannot rely solely on Dual Identity
 to protect herself.
 It does not prevent others from suspecting a Luminous' nature based on
 circumstantial evidence.
 She cannot simply dip into a closet only to return as a mysterious magical
 girl, and not expect others to not draw the connection eventually.
 She obviously cannot transform in front of someone, and expect Dual Identity
 to protect her even slightly.
\end_layout

In cases where she needs to intentionally prove her identity, she may spend
 a Willpower to drop this protection for the rest of a scene.
 This does not necessarily convince others that she is the same person if
 she looks radically different in her two forms, but it at least removes
 any supernatural components of her disguise.

When she reverts to Mundane Form after transforming or visiting the Dream

 She is ever so slightly distracted by the dreams and imaginations that

 her Mundane Form.
 However, she gains a bonus on her Transformation rolls equal to the usual
 penalty.
 Once a scene, if she fails an important roll or suffers significant social
 complications due to this, she gains a Beat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flicker lasts for ten minutes if the Luminous had been transformed for less
 than a scene, one scene if she had been transformed for a whole scene or
 longer, one hour if she had been transformed for a day or longer, one day
 if she had been transformed for a week or longer, and one week if she had
 been transformed for a month or longer.
 Every time the Flicker duration elapses, the penalty lowers by one.
 If she transforms or otherwise triggers Flicker before it fully fades,
 the penalty severity resets.
 Further transformations cannot decrease the duration for Flicker to fade,
 but it can increase it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, at Reverie 6 or above, Flicker no longer requires a Luminous
 to intentionally transform.
 Mundane dreams trigger Flicker too, with a duration of one hour.

Flicker, then, is something that the dream themes of Luminous make possible.
 They get used to falling into their dreams, letting those winds carry them

Childish (••) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Effect:
\series default
 Your character appears as a younger child when transformed.
 She is of Size 3 in Dream Form, and gains a +3 bonus to any attempt to
 hide or go unnoticed.
 The Storyteller should consider applying bonuses for other situations where
 her small size or apparent age may help, such as fitting through a small
 crawl space, or convincing others of her innocence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Drawback: 
\series default
Your character is treated as she appears outside of the supernatural world.
 She should expect to be questioned by adults when traveling alone.
 She receives a -3 modifier to any attempt to physically intimidate another

Innate Regalia (••)

\begin_layout Standard

Effect:
\series default
 Your character has a Regalia component that is innate to their form, and
 cannot simply be summoned and unsummoned at will.
 Reduce her Regalia Capacity by one.
 She permanently has a Regalia of your choice active in Dream Form, bound
 to two Invocations chosen when you buy this merit without cost.
 The Regalia has to be something you can justify to the Storyteller as innate
 to your character's body.
 For example, a robot girl may have her Levinbolt integrated into her arm,
 and a fairy boy may have his Wings of Light be...

\begin_layout Standard

Effect:
\series default
 Your character's Dream Form is particularly large and imposing, towering
 over most others.
 She is Size 6 in Dream Form, and gains a +2 bonus to any rolls to physically
 intimidate another, or reassure someone that she can protect them.
 The Storyteller should consider applying bonuses for other situations where
 her larger size may help, such as climbing over tall walls.

Effect:

 Your character is quite the fashionista, and she may appear in whatever
 outfit she wishes when she transforms into her Dream Form.
 Her Dream Form still always looks to be the same person, just in a different
 outfit.
 If her Dream Form has obviously supernatural features, the most this can
 do to hide them is to cover them with clothes – it cannot dismiss them
 entirely.

Effect:

 Your character is diminutive when transformed.
 She is Size 4 in Dream Form, and gains a +2 bonus to any rolls to hide,

 The Storyteller should consider applying bonuses for other situations where
 her small size or unassuming appearance may help, such as fitting through
 a small crawl space, or reassuring another that she won't harm them.

You do not already have Sensitivity from another source; and have human-like
 enough emotions to emphasize strongly with others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Effect: 
\series default
While a Luminous' empathy is enhanced greatly by her magic, it isn't fundamental
ly different from simply being very empathic for mundane reasons.
 Your character gains the Sensitivity trait, with a single dice of Sensitivity.
 For each additional dot she takes in this merit above 2, she gains an additiona
l Sensitivity dice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-Luminous characters may only replace a single Aspiration from Sensitivity.
 If she would receive an Hope attack or Hope damage, she instead rolls Resolve

 If she fails, she receives a Hope Condition.
 If she dramatically fails, she receives a persistent Hope Condition.

All Luminous must draw their magic from their imagination – whether they
 were lost in their own dreams, or learned to be so after their Blossoming.
 In an act of will, they call the form they take in those dreams into reality.
 When that alone isn't enough to overcome the world's woes, they turn to
 their greater powers.
 In further acts of will, they project more of their Dream into the walking
 world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through their Regalia, the Luminous weave further extensions of their will
 into their Dream Form, manifesting as shining arms, auras of light or wings
 of stardust.
 Through their Domains, the Luminous shape not only their own being but

 Through their Charms, the Luminous draw the ways and concepts of the Dream

Clash of Wills 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, opposing supernatural beings will use their powers in ways where
 both can't succeed at the same time and it isn't clear which ability should
 trump another.
 When the effects of supernatural abilities clash in this way, it triggers
 a Clash of Wills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each Luminous involved rolls Reverie + the highest Invocation involved in
 the power.
 The player who rolls the highest wins, and their ability takes effect.
 If no Invocations can be applied to the power, use the Luminous' highest
 Invocation instead.
 On a tie, reroll the contest until one player rolls more successes than
 each other player.
 Other types of supernatural being have their own dice pools for Clash of
 Wills, which can be found in their source books.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Characters may spend Willpower to bolster the contested roll, but only if
 they are physically present and aware that their powers are clashing.
 Certain powers, such as those with exceptionally long durations, are more
 enduring in a clash.
 Day-long effects add one die to the clash roll, week-long effects add two,
 month-long three, and effects that could last a year or longer add four.

Regalia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With their Regalia, the Luminous weave superhuman abilities and touches
 of magic into their Dream Form.
 Even when they appear to be equipment and shining arms, a Luminous' Regalia
 are not truly separate from her.
 Her sword feels like as much part her as her lace wings, and she wields
 it with an almost surreal fluidity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As extensions of her Dream Form, Regalia are not truly equipment – although
 they may be used as such, and can provide equipment bonuses as if they
 were such.
 Regalia do not function for anyone other than the Luminous who summoned
 them, and dissolve into motes of light a short moment after they leave
 their presence.
 Disarming Luminous is rarely useful, as they may reflexively recall any
 Regalia they have lost on their turn at no cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous may summon her Regalia when she transforms into her Dream form,
 as an instant action, or by spending a Willpower as a reflexive action.
 She unsummons any existing Regalia she may have active.
 For every point of Regalia Capacity she has, she may bind a single Invocation
 to a single Regalia.
 The same Invocation can be bound to multiple Regalia, and multiple Invocations
 can be bound to a single Regalia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She benefits from the base effect of any Regalia she has an Invocation bound
 to.
 She gains the effects of all Upgrades to a Regalia she has the proper Invocatio
n bound to, and enough dots in the Invocation to qualify for.
 Variants are special Upgrades that replace the base effect of the Regalia.
 When swapping Regalia, she may replace the base effect of any Regalia with

Dream Form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Dream Form is nothing truly unique in a world of dreams.
 All visitors in the Dream (or other mental spaces) manifest a Dream Form
 rather than their physical bodies.
 The Dream Forms of mortals have their own limitations, however, compared
 to those of the Luminous:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Instead of using the highest of his attributes, a mortal's Dream Attributes
 are based on his mental attributes.
 He uses Intelligence for Power, Wits for Finesse, and Resolve for Resistance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mortals suffer wound penalties to Dream Health as usual.
 Neither Luminous or mortals have any protection against physical attacks
 in the Dream, as all attacks are partly magical in a sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mortals cannot perform Weaving Actions, have no Weaving Skills, and do not
 have Dual Identity.
 As such, they add Athletics instead of Flow to their Defense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous enjoy additional benefits in the Dream proper.
 They are always in their Dream Form, but may still take on the appearance
 of their Mundane Form.
 Dual Identity applies as usual when they do so.
 Furthermore, in either form, she may choose whether supernatural powers
 affect her as if she were a mortal or a supernatural being.

Fading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When they Blossom, the Luminous become living dreams.
 Though those dreams never truly stop being human at their heart, they are
 still what will remain of the Luminous at the very end.
 As long as their dreams live, they do too, even when their mundane body
 withers away from time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a Hopeful dies in her Mundane Form while still able to transform, she
 may transform one last time, burning away her Mundane Form entirely in
 the process.
 She immediately refills her Motes Pool and heals all Hope damage.
 Her physical body is lost to her and she begins to Fade.
 The same may happen if she retreats into the dream and lets her mundane
 body wither away, or simply outlives her natural lifespan while transformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of how it comes to be, the Luminous begin to dissolve into the
 Dream, as the stray thoughts of humanity and foreign emotions lap at the
 edges of their mind.
 They anchor themselves against those tides by force of will, clinging tight
 to those they love, to the place they know they have in the world.
 Hope sustains them in the same way food and air does a mundane human.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fading Luminous no longer regain Willpower form rest, and suffer a box of
 severe Hope damage every day.
 Should their entire Hope track be filled with severe Damage, their will
 dissipates fully into the Dream and their body dissolves into motes of
 light.
 The same occurs if their Dream Health is exhausted, or they suffers the
 Soul Shocked Condition for any other reason.

Physical realities such as old age, dying, or not having a soul don't quite
 affect the Luminous nearly as hard as they should.
 After all, they are people who have become dreams.

 They just fade away if they run out of Hope, and the constant Severe Hope
 damage makes it hard.

Elder Luminous...?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While they can theoretically live indefinitely, no Luminous older than a
 century and a half or so have shown themselves to the broader community.
 Some say it's because of how difficult it is for a Luminous to hang on,
 especially as their friends pass away with the passage of time.
 Before the internet and the Information Age, finding others who got it
 was always a struggle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Perhaps a few group of truly elder Luminous have hidden themselves away
 in some corner of the Dream or some deep forest together.
 A close-knit Nakama of elder Luminous may indeed be able to sustain themselves
 like that.
 But...
 if they exist, they've certainly since secluded themselves away or chosen
 to guide the world from the shadows as the Maou do.
 Others say even that's unlikely – that such isolation would itself tear
 at the Luminous and that they wouldn't survive like that.

\begin_layout Section
Young Luminous
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Far too many Hopeful do not have the luxury of waiting until adulthood to
 grasp the power of the Dream.
 The cruelties of the world always start far too early.
 Especially compared with other types of supernatural beings, Luminous tend
 to Blossom very early, with all the complications and benefits it comes
 with.
 On one hand...
 becoming something else is too often effectively the end of their childhood.
 On the other hand, too often that childhood is one they would not wish
 to continue even if they had the choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Luminous: the Dream
\emph default
 may be used with the rules for child characters found in 
\emph on
World of Darkness: Innocents
\emph default
.
 While such a game is fundamentally a Luminous chronicle at its heart, those
 rules are still useful to represent a characters' significant younger Mundane
 Form.
 The Luminous template may be used in combination with the Innocent template.
 Create the character as a normal Luminous with the following modifications:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She has a lower number of mundane skill dots equal to the normal total for
 her age, and may not place dots in a category exceeding the normal maximum
 for her age's primary category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Her mundane skills have a cap of three dots, which increases to four dots
 at Reverie 2 and five dots at Reverie 4.
 At Reverie 4, refund all Prodigy merits under the Sanctity of Merits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She has the Study skill instead of Academics and Science.
 It counts as part of the Learn Weaving skill.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
She may buy the Youthful merit for free.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Mundane Form, the usual rules for young characters apply to her.
 For example, she suffers increased wounds penalties, is easy to beat down,
 and has a significant disadvantage versus adults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Luminous do not suffer any of the usual drawbacks of childhood in their
 Dream Form.
 While their mundane actions versus adults are still penalized, this does
 not apply to Weaving Actions or the use of magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With some cunning, Luminous may acquire social merits normally forbidden
 to young characters – up to and including a full adult Alternate Identity
 given enough persistence and an appropriate Dream Form.

World of Darkness: Innocents Summary 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section contains a brief summary of the important rules for child character
s found in 
\emph on
World of Darkness: Innocents
\emph default
.
 Using the full source book is very much recommended as it also provides
 useful thematic guidelines and flavor context as to the rules.
 This summary, then, is meant for use as a quick reference, as a backup
 if you do not have access to 
\emph on
Innocents
\emph default
, and to serve as a partial update to Chronicles of Darkness rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Virtue/Vice:
\series default
 Children use Virtue/Vice like other mortals.
 While in Innocents, they have different Anchors called Asset/Fault, these
 work identically to CofD's version of Virtue/Vice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Morality and Triggers:
\series default
 Children use Integrity like other mortals.
 As Triggers were a replacement for derangements in Innocents, they are
 superseded by breaking point conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Attributes:
\series default
 Children allocate attributes the same way as older characters.
 As their dots are compared to the average of their age, they are still
 worse than adults with the same scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skills:
\series default
 Young characters are normally capped to 3 dots in each skill.
 Furthermore, they have fewer skill points to allocate based on their age.
 7-year-old children allocate 6/5/2 skills, 8-year-olds allocate 7/4/2,
 9-year-olds allocate 7/4/2, 10-year-olds allocate 8/5/3, 11-year-olds allocate
 8/5/3, 12-year-olds allocate 9/5/3, and teenagers allocate 10/6/4.
 Children younger than 10 have 1 skill speciality, children 10 or older
 have 2 skill specialities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Skill List:
\series default
 Children have a Study skill representing their skill at studying and schoolwork.
 This replaces their Academics and Science skills.
 They may not have the Drive skill except in special circumstances that
 would logically allow it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Escape:
\series default
 Children are especially skilled at escaping from combat.
 As long as their opponent is not fully focused on them, a child may attempt
 to escape or hide.
 Escape requires an Dexterity + Wits vs Wits + Composure roll, and hiding
 requires a Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure roll.
 Notably, in the context of Luminous, a transformation is certainly enough
 of a distraction to invoke this rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Firearms:
\series default
 The first time in a combat a character under about the age of 12 unused
 to gunfire is shot at, must spend a point of Willpower or be Beaten Down.
 Furthermore, when such a character attempts to shoot a firearm at someone
 for the first time, she must pass a Resolve + Composure roll or she misses
 and must roll again the next time she tries.
 Luminous who have fought in Dream Form before are exempt from this penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Wound Penalties:
\series default
 Children are especially vulnerable to wound penalties compared to adults.
 Instead of the normal benchmarks, she suffers a -1 penalty to all actions
 when her fifth-to-last health box is damaged, loses 10-again when her fourth-to
-last is marked, suffers a -2 penalty when her third-to-last health box
 is damaged, cannot spend Willpower to boost rolls when her second-to-last
 is marked, and suffers a -3 penalty when her last box is damaged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Stunning:
\series default
 The Stunning rules in Innocents are superseded by Beaten Down & Surrender
 optional rule.
 That rule always applies to children, even in chronicles where it doesn't
 to adults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Adults vs Children:
\series default
 Adults gain 8-again on all rolls against children, except when they try
 to hide or escape.
 Unarmed attacks by children against adults suffer a penalty equal to their
 Stamina.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Growing Up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One day, childhood must end even for the most imaginative or innocent of
 people.
 Even the Luminous, who are caught in the middle of the responsibility of
 adulthood and the wonders and dreams of childhood, are burdened with everchangi
ng obligations and restrictions in their mundane life.
 While many choose to spend their younger years continuing their fight,
 others often lay low for quite a while to establish themselves further
 in adult life.
 To skip a child character to adulthood, apply the following changes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remove any merits that no longer make sense and refund them under the Sanctity
 of Merits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduce all mundane skills the character has dots in by one dot (down to
 a minimum of one dot), then give them mundane skill dots up to the normal
 adult total of 22 if they have less.
 For Luminous characters, if this would reduce one of their transformed
 skills, she gains transformed skill dots to make up the difference.
 If this would increase her transformed skills, she loses transformed skill
 dots to make up the difference if possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Grant the character 20 experiences + 1 experience for every year that has
 passed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Luminous characters gain a dot of Reverie in addition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Chapter 6: Rainbow Skies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous only wove a small part of the Dream all of humanity shares
 into their Kingdoms.
 Beyond them, the skies are dyed in so many colors, touched by so many strange
 powers.
 Long ago, a rare few Hopeful seeked to understand them, dove deeply enough
 into their mysteries, that some nameless barrier broke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond that barrier, they saw a path.
 They would reach out into the Dream again as when they first Blossomed,
 to Blossom again under the light of a different power.
 They wove something stranger, further off notions into their Soulspaces
 alongside those they always wielded, allowing their new Weave and Origin
 to infuse every aspect of their magic and being.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Back then, Weaves were a means of survival.
 The Luminous were vulnerable in that era before they knew how to fight
 with the Dream or how to weave a Dual Identity.
 They masqueraded as other creatures, hiding among their ranks for protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current day, the reasons the Hopeful take on Weaves are as colorful
 as the Hopeful themselves.
 Some wish to show the world that even stranger powers still can be used
 in the name of good.
 Some still wish to live among the other creatures of the night, feeling
 a kinship with they they cannot find elsewhere.
 Some live in places where the protection of Dual Identity isn't enough
 to protect them.
 Then, there are those who simply wish to, feeling some nameless rightness
 in what they would become.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The latter especially tend to be responsible for the strangest of phenomenon.
 Not all Luminous who take on a Weave must Blossom twice.
 Some resonate so much with a particular power that they take it on when
 they Blossom the first time.

Weaves and Origins serve as the core of Luminous crossover support, as Embassies
 do in Princess.
 They...
 do support a lot of Luminous themes, hence why they're presented as a full
 chapter, not an appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous embrace the stranger things of the world.
 They aren't the kind of people to shy away from being strange, or accepting
 that which most people would reject.
 The Weave of Names threatens to fracture a Luminous' identity, if they
 had not already been multiple.
 The Weave of Bonds threatens to make its participants lose themselves in
 each other.
 It's no wonder then, that they would see no issue in accepting forces that
 were never quite humanity's to begin with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Unlike in Beast, in Luminous, crossover is about the bonds outcasts forge
 with each other.
 They have no overarching story for what binds them together with other
 supernatural creatures, because they don't need one.
 They connect with the human side of other supernatural creatures, and such
 interpersonal bonds can break through any remaining differences in supernatural
 nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In their Origins, they embrace what being a different kind of supernatural
 creature would mean for them, abandoning even the caution that Princesses
 show in their Embassies.
 They come out changed, but no less bright for it.
 That's the point.

Accepting Weaves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether a Luminous takes on on a Weave when she first Blossoms, or later
 on in a second Blossoming, the effect is the same.
 She spends 3 Experiences, and chooses an Origin compatible with her Weave.
 She gains the Weave's base ability and all the Origin's effects.
 Thereafter, she is forever changed.
 Thus, no Luminous may ever take on more than one Weave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She gains ranks in the Weave for every dot of her Inner Light, and gains
 one more every time it increases.
 For each rank, she may buy a single Perk associated with her Weave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Commentary
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Weaves have a pretty similar structure to Entitlements, though simplified
 into something more like a Feat tree or Exalted-style Charm tree.
 This makes them pretty good for focused concepts that define something
 core to the character (e.g.
 the Weave of Bonds and the Weave of Names), or those focus strongly on
 a single core concept (e.g.
 the Weave of Daydreams).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In that sense, they function more as a second template than anything else.
 Not inappropriate, considering they are usually more about things a Luminous
 can be, than powers she wields.

 In even rarer cases still, a Luminous may take on a power not of the Dream

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some other supernatural forces have such titles of their own such as a Changelin
g's Entitlements or a Mage's Legacies – and given the right situation, a
 Luminous may find herself burdened with their arcane responsibilities.
 She gains an Origin that reflects what she accepted an power from.
 The Storyteller should adjudicate how exactly such foreign powers affect
 the Luminous – in general, it becomes something more like a Weave in structure
 while keeping its own core themes.

Origins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Luminous takes on a Weave, she accepts another force into her soul,
 embracing it as she once did the Dream.
 Such a blatant embrace of the supernatural burns away some measure of the
 mundanity she once enjoyed, and binds all of her magic with the touch of
 a foreign force.
 Abilities may affect and detect such Luminous and their powers using anything
 that can detect the powers of the Dream, Will, or their Origin.

Origins serve as a point of customization, as the same concept could often
 be achieved through multiple foreign forces – or even the Dream's own touch.
 They serve a pair of related purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First, it makes it easier for Storytellers and players to write Weaves,
 since their complexity is limited to their core features.
 Secondly, they function as an unified set of downsides, so Weaves don't

Spirit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world itself dreams too, hidden far in the World Dream beyond the Threshold.
 As the waking world reflects onto the Shadow, so too do the spirits that
 live in it reflect into the World Dream.
 Long ago, a Luminous braved the Gales to reach its heart, and learned of
 the powers the Spirits dreamed of.
 Nobody remembers why.
 Perhaps it was desperation, perhaps it was in pursuit of some nameless
 calling.
 Regardless, a memory of the journey remains in the Dream Kingdoms in this
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Hopeful draws on that memory once more, she is thrown into an dangerous
 and all too real dream reflection of the Shadow.
 She feels small in comparison to the savage and passionate creatures of
 the natural world, yet catching a glimpse of the delicate balance they
 uphold through conflict.
 Grasping for power as they all do, she takes on a Resonance to call her
 own.
 Asserting herself against the flows of the world, she craves herself a
 place in the World Dream.

\begin_layout Standard
The Spirit is a savage world where each fends for themselves.

\begin_layout Standard
Ancient vows and pacts older than the Gentry themselves bind the Dream and
 the world of the fae together.
 Whatever its origin, the Dreaming Roads were born before any Luminous or
 True Fae laid eyes on the world.
 Far too often, the Luminous found themselves walking those roads into a
 world more real than a dream.
 There, they first touched the power of Wyrd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a Hopeful accepts the powers of the Wyrd, she dreams of a memory of
 a fae world from long ago.
 She makes an oath to a beautiful fairy queen, the voice of the world itself
 – or whatever she imagines the Wyrd's face to be.
 By the terms of that accord between the Hopeful and fae, she discards her
 usual transformation in favor of the Mask that veils all fae from mortal
 eyes.

Dreams and fae magic were always well connected, so this is probably the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Luminous with ties to Wyrd have a Mask and are locked into Dream Form.
 They are vulnerable to iron.
 Finally, the Mask veils her from being easily detected as a Luminous and
 hides the stranger traits of her Dream Form the same way it hides a Changeling'

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fae Nature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Wyrd asks the Luminous join the agreements of the fae in exchange for

 to join the Oaths of the fae.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such, iron forevermore considers her an enemy.
 The Wyrd permeates her magic, and so it too cannot defend her against the
 touch of iron.
 Iron pierces through her Regalia that provide Armor or enhanced Defense,
 and her attempts to use her Domains on it fail.
 Cold iron furthermore acts as a bane to her.
 She suffers aggravated damage from its touch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Veiled Dream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Luminous' Transformation is fundamentally changed by the Wyrd.
 She is locked into her Dream Form, and cannot intentionally revert to her
 Mundane Form.
 In exchange, her Dream Form is hidden under a fae Mask.
 She spends Motes instead of Glamour when interacting with the Mask.
 While she may break her Mask, this has no benefits or drawbacks for the
 Luminous beyond revealing their supernatural nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of how she looked before, her Dream Form under her Mask gains
 a fantastical, mystical feel that marks her as clearly supernatural.
 What was once a flower worn in their hair grows into a tangle of vines
 and blooms.
 A hairstyle that evoked the feel of fire instead becomes an actual smoldering
 blaze.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should she be forced out of Dream Form, she reverts to her Mundane Form.
 She reflexively transforms as soon as she is able to, and suffers constant
 Flicker at the maximum penalty allowed by her Reverie as long as she is
 untransformed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For all these troubles, her Mask veils her native powers from detection.
 Supernatural effects detect her as nothing more than a Changeling.
 Likewise, it causes mortals to explain away or miss the supernatural nature
 of her Form Merits or Weaving Actions.

The fae conceal themselves from the mundane world behind a powerful illusion
 deeply embedded into their nature.
 To all mortal senses and mundane technology, anything touched by fae magic
 looks to be ordinary.
 Mortals do not notice the smell of lilacs come from the fae's hair, but
 simply assume it perfume.
 Even the coldness of an ice elemental's skin doesn't seem remarkable when
 veiled by the fae illusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This illusion is called a fae being or object's Mask, and their true form
 is called their Mein.
 Unlike a Luminous' Mundane Form, this illusion has no effect on magical
 forces.
 The mundane senses of magical beings are fooled, but their powers are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Fae only see the Mein of their fellows.
 They must spend a Glamour to see another's mask for a few brief seconds.
 In response, another fae may spend a Glamour to reinforce her mask, hiding
 her Mein even from other fae – leaving only a few tells such as her true
 form in her her shadow.
 Alternatively, a fae may spend a Glamour to burn away her Mask for a scene,
 revealing her true form in a dazzling magical display not unlike a Princess'
 transformation.
 This increases the effectiveness of the fae's Contracts and rends open
 gateways to Faerie nearby her.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
Once we took the world into our hands.
 We defied the gods.
 We ate the Forbidden Fruit.
 We stole the secrets of fire from the Gods.
 In that one moment we forged the power that became our regal and unwavering
 Will.
 And we built.
 We built a world to call our own over long centuries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
The bonfires we stole beat back the darkness that covered the world just
 ever so little.
 Ever so little that we could see clearly what we had to do to make the
 world ours.
 We plowed the ground, following the secrets we stole from the Tree of Knowledge.
 We sowed the seeds that would one day take root.
 That one day would sustain a world eons to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
In our stories, we remember how we set off on our long and dark path.
 We warn of the thorns we would find on that path...

Sakura leaned over a railing atop a tower, overlooking a city of shining
 glass and regal metal, still gleaming even under the pale moonlight.
 Thinking of the rice fields that once covered that entire concrete landscape.
 Soon it would be her turn to write.
 Her grandfather once taught her his own legacy, how to shape the Will that
 lie in all our hearts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
He taught she must do, what her purpose in this world must be.
 He taught her how to rule.
 He taught her the hard choices she would have to make, when the Dark gave
 her no perfect answer.
 ...
 and how to strike back at the Dark's grasp, so she would never have to
 once more.
\end_layout

But now, he rested on what would soon be his deathbed.

, he once said.
 They both knew it was a lie.
 But it was a lie that pushed her forward.
 It was time to face the truth now.
 She stepped out, back into the streets of the city she would soon call
 her own, staring into the sky.
 The tears had already dried.
 She was simply left with the burdens she inherited and the memories of
 what she had lost.
\end_layout

Even if nobody would recognize her face at the end of her own chapter,.
 even if she must pass on the torch unseen one day, even if she would have
 to remind those who were powerful and those who dreamed alike why she must
 be feared too, even if she had to face the Dark alone...
 she was happy to have a place in this world.
 And she knew.
 Every once of those things would happen, one day.

Caught between so many forces, cities like this were always only a breeze
 away from falling apart at the seams.
 When the Dreamers seek to reweave its weft, she would be there to guide

 When stranger forces came to take it for their own, she would be there
 to stand against them.
 When the powerful forget that they will one day have their own descendants,
 she would be there to remind them.

 is a game about those who drive the world forward from the shadows.
 They are the ones behind stories of the Illuminati, stories of the Freemasons.
 In a world besieged by Darkness and shadows, they alone hold the line.
 They alone carry on the torch that keeps humanity afloat a sea of shadows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this game, you play one of the Maou, one such soul who wields the only
 power humanity may call its own – our power to bend the world to our will.
 Some shaped the world through technology, through medicine, through decrees
 alone.
 They never learned of our true potential, the power they could reach for
 if they reached deep inside.
 You did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You hold a legacy from a time before we knew how to write our words onto
 paper, and know you will one day pass it on.
 In the space in between, you do what you can to keep the world your ancestors
 built alive.
 Whether you hold obvious power or rule from the shadows, that is your purpose,
 and that is the Vow you made when you agreed to carry on that legacy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will not be easy.
 Shadows strike at the world from all directions.
 The closest thing you have to an ally dream so brightly that they threaten
 to lull the world into an eternal sleep.
 Humanity's eyes are covered with an veil, pulled over them by the Dark
 forces of the world.
 They hold a knife at humanity's throat, threatening to cut it all if they
 came to know.
 So you walk the path alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You know that this world should belong to humanity.
 You know this isn't how it's meant to be.
 So you will fight.
 If humanity cannot know of the Dark, you will give them the most light

 If they cannot be allowed to know of what you are, you will guide their
 path towards that future from the shadows.

Maou are a fusion of the concepts behind the Twilight Courts, Mnemosynes,

As the ideas developed, I realized that Maou are quite an interesting faction

 At worst dark gray, than ever truly black.
 They are not the true antagonists of Luminous, and nor are Luminous the

 Hence, I decide to make them simply another playable splat of their own

 the line is blurry at the best of times.
 The powers of the Luminous set them apart, yes, but...
 do they truly want different things? Are their views truly incompatible?
 Is it as the Luminous say, that they are allies, and the Maou simply scared?
 Is it as the Maou say, and that the Luminous mean well, but do not understand
 the world?

Chapter 1: The Lineage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Life shapes the world around them as it changes.
 That has been the way it was from the start.
 At the end of that old Lineage, from the chaotic play of flesh and vine,
 one species rose beyond.
 They not only looked upon the world in fixed, instinctive patterns, but
 came to see it as it truly was.
 Adrift, lost, and above all else, malleable.
 They saw that they could change the world, and that they did not exist
 to its whims.
 Only when we learned our future was ours to build, did humanity's true
 story begin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We looked upon a world that could be ours.
 Our nascent souls ignited in this revelation, sparking the one power we
 could truly call our own: Will.
 Through that power, we built our world of cities, roads and networks over
 generations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lineage the Maou inherit is cast down from that era, in all its glory
 and faults.
 They are the ones that maintain the path humanity set themselves on generations
 ago.
 They vow to maintain humanity on the true path, pruning the branches that
 would lead humanity back into the chaos and wilderness of old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their Ancestry reflects the ideals they hold, and the path they wish to
 see humanity continue down.
 Their Keystone is the means by which they anchor their Will into a coherent
 force.

\begin_layout Standard
Every human dreams in the night, even if they forget it in the day.
 We dream of impossible worlds that could never be, and wish with all our
 hearts to make them so regardless.
 The Keystone of Dreams holds the power to bind them into reality, upending
 natural law in favor of the light of stories and dreams.
 It holds the power to connect dreams, allowing those who would never meet
 in reality to know each other in a way siblings and lovers would envy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is all true, and yet, it is no longer a power of the Maou.
 In an era before the first records were written into history, the first
 Dreamers built their own worlds into the Astral, a reflection of what they
 wished the world to be.
 Through their ephemeral touch, they built families and small communities
 bound by shared understanding.
 Through their Light, they erased the pains of the world and brought what
 would be tragedies towards better endings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dreamers always imagined what the world could be if it were only a small
 bit fundamentally different, rather than looking to the here and now.
 When they wanted to prepare for tomorrow, and the Maou wanted to live for
 today, they always fought.
 The two sides drifted apart, sketching the shape of an inevitable tragedy
 to come.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those who hold the Keystone of Dreams are Luminous, the wayward children
 of the Lineage.
 They are the ones who dream of worlds far better than those the Maou build,

 their dreams may break.

 in effect, in every way that matters, they are no longer Maou.

The World of Darkness is filled with all kinds of supernatural beings, all

Kinship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maou and Luminous both have the same Kinship with Beasts as the Awakened.
 However, a Luminous' Mundane Form veils this fact – she has no Kinship
 with Beasts in Mundane Form.
 Due to their stronger connection with the mundane, Thicker Than Water does
 not affect the Luminous.
 However, if a Beast applies the Family Ties condition, it applies even
 in a Luminous' Mundane Form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Passing Resemblance has little use with the Luminous or the Maou.
 They do not have means to recognize each other passively, instead using
 their powers to reveal their nature to others.
 At best, a Beast can pass for a transformed Luminous by faking the dissonance
 with physics that Weaving Actions can cause.

Interactions

Changelings and Luminous both touch on dreams and stories, if from opposite

 Both seek comfort in their friends and support systems.
 Those similarities lead to a few interactions between their powers and
 worlds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Clarity and Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clarity and Hope are very similar mechanics, both serving as a health-like
 track that replaces Integrity.
 Supernatural powers that can effect either Hope or Clarity should apply
 to the other without modifications.
 Supernatural powers that do not involve some component of genuine interaction
 cannot heal Hope.
 A Mage spell would not have much significant effect in restoring Hope,
 but the Fortifying Presence Contract can heal Hope as easily as Clarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one of a Changeling's Touchstones possesses Sensitivity, they may use
 Take their Hand to heal Clarity, not only Hope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the Storyteller's discretion, Changelings with the Sensitivity merit
 may suffer Clarity damage and Clarity conditions rather than Hope conditions
 alone, using the same mechanics as for Luminous.
 Roll Clarity attacks caused by Sensitivity using the rules for Hope attacks
 – the Changeling simply takes mild Clarity damage equal to the number of
 successes the attack shows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Hedge and The Dream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magic of the Luminous is centered upon shaping their own Dreams, and
 imposing it upon reality to begin with.
 Hedgespinning comes as naturally to them as any fae creature, and they
 may simply pay Motes in place of Glamour.
 They cannot shape the Hedge as they do the Dream – while it responds to
 emotion and thought, it is still a solid world of its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, Changelings in the Dream (as the Luminous define it) may Dreamweave
 as in personal dreams.
 They lose this power in the hearts of the Dream Kingdoms or the Deep Dream.
 She may apply Dreamweaving successes make Conceptual Attacks if her actions
 could justify doing so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maou may similarly Hedgespin by paying Motes, but cannot do so as naturally.
 They cannot perform Paradigm shifts, and must possess Fabula ••• or Prisma
 at •.

Dreams and fae magic are closely tied.
 Luminous can approach the Hedge with their experience manipulating dreams,

\begin_layout Section
Demon: the Descent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous hold the power to connect people's hearts, and Demons hide powers
 to lie to the world itself.
 Their powers inevitably conflict, and worse yet, the two cannot simply
 avoid each other.
 Both veil themselves as mundane humans, and they cannot recognize each
 other for what they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Bonds and Lies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Demon's may lies fool the Dream itself.
 If he hides his true feelings from the one he loves, he may suppress bonds
 of Intimacy that would normally be woven.
 If he presents himself as feeling closer to someone than he does, he may
 create bonds of Intimacy he does not truly mean.
 However, to create a false bond of Intimacy like that means to put one's
 self at the mercy of a Luminous' Echo.
 Her power was not meant to be lied to, and it acts unwittingly to create
 a bond rather than reinforce one that already exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As long as a Demon fakes Strong Intimacy with a Luminous, her Echo conducts
 Social Maneuvering against the Demon with the goal to bring his true feelings
 in line with his false Intimacy.
 Every week, she rolls Power + Resonate - the Demon's Composure to attempt
 to open a door.
 Should he fake an Connected Intimacy instead, this roll gains the rote
 quality and occurs once per night.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Echoes, thankfully, cannot reveal a Demon's nature to the Luminous.
 It treats a Demon's Covers as if they were protected by a Luminous' Dual
 Identity, even at Strong or Connected Intimacy.
 This does not require a roll and is not Spoofing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Weave of Bonds fundamentally destroys the separation Liar's Tongue relies
 on – it has no effect on a Demon's Partner.
 Any Demon who would willingly accept such a Weave, though, would likely
 consider this a benefit more than an downside.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This was a hard one to figure out.
 Demons lie, their deceptions and the Pacts that force them are so core
 to their splat.
 Luminous have a power that connects hearts.
 Every Demon power that reflects their abilities to lie draw on the separation
 between their bodies and their minds.
 Which...
 doesn't help much when Luminous connect minds directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Still, it isn't any good if Demons are stymied from making Pacts with a
 Luminous even tangentially involved.
 Hence, the Echo is...
 a danger for Demons, but not one that stops them from trying.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Pacts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demon Pacts do not pierce a Luminous' Dual Identity, unless the Demon is
 aware of it and specifically writes the Pact to account for her two forms.
 Thus, a Luminous could trade away her relationship with a friend in Mundane
 Form to a Demon, and still maintain that relationship in her Dream Form
 – and in fact, this is the default for Demons unaware of her nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a Soul Pact treats her two forms separately.
 A Soul Pact with a Luminous' Mundane Form gives the Demon her entire mundane
 life as usual – however, the Luminous may live on through her Dream Form
 (with the usual effects of Fading).
 A Soul Pact with a Luminous' Dream Form consumes both her identities, annihilat
ing her entirely.
 This has the usual effects of a Demon attempting to take a supernatural
 soul as a Cover.

 in addition to the usual Withstand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of Mage, Defiant Will is somewhat broader than its description
 would imply.
 Attempts to use Death to influence a Willful's soul, or use Space to affect
 a Luminous' relationships with anyone them have Strong or Connected Intimacy
 with also trigger Defiant Will, in addition to the obvious Mind effects.
 More indirect Arcana like Fate or Time are not impeded.

Withstand is complicated.
 I really wish I could make Hope factor into Withstand somehow, but the
 scaling never quite worked out without extreme complexity.
 Easier to just hit their dice pool.

Arcana and Willful Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magic of the Luminous and Maou have varied effects on the world, and
 hence the best Arcana to use depends the power being studied.
 Luminous magic tends to work by means similar to the Mind, Space and Forces
 Arcana.
 Maou magic tends to work by means similar to the Fate, Mind and Matter
 Arcana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The description of powers have more influence than their effects – for example,
 while Mages would normally achieve effects like Shining Vow using Fate,
 the Charm would be best studied using the Mind Arcana.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Dream Form is obviously a projection of her dreams under Mind
 Mage Sight, and other Arcana treat her as what she appears to be.
 Normally Life is required to affect her as with most living beings, but
 some Luminous may have less conventional forms.
 A Luminous' Echo is best studied with Mind and Space.Bonds of Intimacy are
 usually similar to the corresponding Sympathetic ties.
 If needed, a Mage may add Mind 1 to Space spells to specifically view or
 manipulate Intimacy.

Motes and Hope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To Mages, Motes are something very similar to Willpower – simply found in
 an abnormal abundance for a normal human.
 As it is not truly a form of energy, the most Mages can do is drain a Mote
 Pool as a Mind Unraveling spell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a Luminous' Hope is simply a measurement of their mental stability.
 To a Mage, does not feel as if a source of supernatural power at all.
 A Mage may cause mild Hope damage equal to Potency with a Mind Flaying
 spell, or severe damage with a Mind Unraveling spell.
 Healing Hope damage is far harder as magically granted emotional strength
 does not fuel a Luminous' magic.
 In mechanical terms, the most a Mage can do to help with Hope is cure Hope
 Conditions, not heal the underlying Hope damage.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transferring Motes would cause a lot of balance issues.
 They regenerate per scene, and...
 that's a subtle but powerful advantage of theirs.
 It shouldn't at all be easily shared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Giving anyone the ability to restore Hope by fiat would also break the game's
 themes.
 Luminous have to struggle versus Hope, and any powerful enough healing
 ability, in my opinion, will damage that severely.
 Changeling's Clarity recovery Contract works because it's so mild, and
 has a significant social interaction component.
 It makes

Soul Magic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the Luminous call their dream worlds Soulspaces, they is more a modificati
on of their Oneiros than a soul as a Mage would call it.
 They still have a true soul, which is treated as an Awakened Soul, even
 in Mundane Form.
 Dual Identity cloaks this fact, and a Mage who tries to use the spell

Sever Soul

 on an untransformed Luminous does not learn why her spell has failed and
 her powers do not detect her soul as anything other than mundane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, Luminous do not suffer from Soul Loss as most beings do.
 The root cause of Fading is not the lack of a physical body – but rather
 their lack of a soul as Mages would recognize it.
 Luminous suffer a variant of Fading instead of Soul Loss.
 As long her as her physical body remains alive, she may still transform
 and still has a Mundane Form.
 Should she Fade in such a state, she loses all Luminous powers and gains
 the Thrall condition [M:tAw 318].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a Luminous can more or less sustain herself indefinitely without a soul,
 it's far from unheard of for Luminous aware of this fact to offer their
 own souls to save someone from Soul Loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maou are far less interesting in this regard.
 Their souls are treated as Awakened Souls.
 They do not innately lose their ability to use their magic when Soulless;
 however because Willpower is their core resources, they will suffer magically
 for it as well.

I don't really like how a lot of fanworks (or at least players of them)
 treat Mage' opinion of what is what as the core canonical answer.
 Luminous think of their Soulspaces as their soul, even if Mages would say
 it's actually their Oneiros.
 There's no point in bending the rest of the book for Mage's sake – I use
 the terms that are most understandable and

The character is bound to their word through the power of a Luminous' magic.
 Should she abandon her promise or act in violation of it, she takes a box

 a Hope Condition.
 The next time each person she made her promise to talks with her, they
