\shape italic
Luminous: the Dream
\shape default
 is a fanmade roleplaying game for the Chronicles of Darkness, published
 by White Wolf Publishing.
 Players take on the role of magical girls or boys who dream of a better
 future for all.
 Who found themselves wielding the power of Light against malign magical
 forces and the mundane cruelties of the world alike.
 Because they know they can make a difference.
 And as long as they can make a difference, they couldn't forgive themselves
 if they didn't at least try.

Credits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Luminous: the Dream
\shape default
 is primary written by AuroraAmissa, with help with several contributors.
 Without their help, this project would have been far more painful than
 it was.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suzune, who wrote many of the basic concepts behind the Maou, and helped
 immensely in working through basic mechanics of the Luminous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ellie, who has provided me a great deal of support through the earlier parts
 of the project, and provided very valuable feedback throughout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hanako, who taught me the way of the dark magical girl.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Xelsius, TrueMrMultiverse, WillOfTheWinds, and MushroomBadger who each helped
 immensely with their feedback and suggestions for Archetypes and similar
 details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end, this project was inspired by and would not exist with many of
 its predecessors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\shape italic
Luminous: the Dream
\shape default
 started as a rewrite of 
\shape italic
Princess: the Hopeful
\shape default
 before it diverged greatly later on in development.
 Some of its core concepts still survive in the Luminous splat.
 That collaboration, in many ways, paved the way for systems like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Over time, 
\shape italic
Changeling: the Dreaming
\shape default
 became more and more of an inspiration for me, as I tried connecting the
 themes of dreams, activism and magical girls.
 In many ways, Luminous has become a spiritual successor to it at this point.

\begin_layout Itemize

Chronicles of Darkness

 There is much to learn from their authors and their works for most game
 designers.

Luminous: the Dream
\shape default
 is written to tell stories about facing the cruelties of the world.
 In the process, it discusses subject matters such as poverty, sexism, racism,
 and all kinds of the mundane and small cruelties that are too often overlooked.
 Such heavy topics can often hit too close to home for many players.
 Safety techniques for such things are discussed in [TODO: Chapter link].

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
Once you were young.
 No matter how old we may be, all of us were once young.
 We looked at the world through truly fresh eyes, felt it as fully and intensely
 as anyone ever could.
 When we loved, it was the happiest days we had ever known.
 When we were hurt, it was the greatest tragedy we had ever felt.
 And the world shined with possibility.
 We all thought we had a way to change the world, embracing it with all
 our hearts.
 We looked to our heroes and told ourselves "I can do that too".
 It seemed that if only we were given our chance, we could make the world
 better.
 That the pains of the world we felt so strongly were something we could
 overcome...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
...
 we believed.
 We all once believed.
 And yet, when you look at the world around you today...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
One day, you saw a man huddling in a corner, covered in all too old rags
 when you came out of the supermarket.
 So many people passed him, looking at him sadly then turning away.
 You could see the desperation on his face.
 You couldn't bear it...
 You give him what cash you had, and a change of clothes.
 It wasn't enough.
 You knew it wasn't enough...
 Not if you were the only one helping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
That night, you confided in your old friend from kindergarten.
 Who you had always relied on, who had always stood by your side back then.
 ...
 and yet, this time, she frowned.
 She asked you if you really thought that money would really change anything,
 or if he would just use it to buy beer.
 She told you she was worried about how you would live through college if
 you kept doing this.
 She told you that you should let people like that go.
 That night, you cried yourself to sleep.
 Why couldn't you just be like them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
One day, you told your parents that you wanted to be a writer instead of
 a doctor.
 They told you that you didn't really want that.
 That you wouldn't ever be popular anyway, and you'd be starving on the
 street.
 They told you that if you threw away your life like that, they wouldn't
 help you anymore.
 They told you to stop being stuck in a dream.
 You weren't sure what else you expected...
 everywhere you went, there were so many people who had given up on hoping
 so long ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
At least, this time was different.
 That night, you logged into the same chat room you found a few weeks ago.
 One full of people who understand your pains.
 They got it.
 They also still believed.
 They also still dreamed.
 And they comforted you.
 Showed you a way forward.
 Reassured you in the path you chose...
 They told you that it was okay to be you.
 This time, you had less reason to cry.
 Even if you still did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
One day, you saw a boy crying in the toy aisle, clinging tightly to a stuffed
 animal he wanted.
 But his parents wouldn't have any of that.
 Because boys weren't supposed to like things like that.
 Because boys weren't supposed to cry.
 Because that is not how the world was supposed to be.
 And so many onlookers walked by, even watched with sneers on their faces.
 You couldn't tell who they even were sneering at, the mother or you.
 It didn't matter.
 Nobody helped.
 Nobody else helped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
...
 but you tried anyway.
 Even as they dragged him away as they called you terrible names.
 He wasn't crying as much anymore.
 ...
 maybe, just maybe.
 You showed him that he wasn't alone in the world.
 Just like your friends once did for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
You never could give up, no matter how hard you tried.
 No matter how much everyone around you told you to save yourself, that
 you were naive and only hurting yourself.
 You couldn't stop caring.
 You couldn't stop believing.
 You couldn't stop trying.
 You couldn't forgive yourself if you did.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size small
And that...
 is what makes you a Luminous.
 Not the shining magic you wield, but the simple fact you could never stop
 dreaming of a better world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous: the Dream is a game about those who dream of a better future inspired
 by the 
\shape italic
mahou shoujo
\shape default
 (or magical girl) genre of Japanese anime and manga.
 It is set in the Chronicles of Darkness, a world much like our own only
 touched by alien wonders and terrors alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 this story is not about them.
 It is about humanity, and the one power we can truly call our own.
 Our shining will to change the world.
 A will that blossomed into a force that could only be called magic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this game, you play a Luminous, one of the shining souls that wields
 the Light.
 Those like you were hidden, shining dimly through so much of history.
 ...
 but shine they did.
 Writing into the untold margins of history, they built the legacy of light
 you now inherent.
 When you Blossomed, you awoke to the world of dreams they hid deep beyond
 the veil of sleep.
 A dream that reflected the world they wanted to wake up to some day, and
 that would shape the Light you would use to bring that world about.

\begin_layout Standard
It will not be easy.
 The world has been a dark place from the start, and even now that clouds
 humanity's hearts.
 There were always those who wouldn't or couldn't dream of brighter.
 Those who merely wished to survive, those who had the hope beaten out of
 them by their parents, those who did not want to make the world better,
 only end up on top.
 They too, have the will to change the world.
 The Luminous call that reversed mirror of their own power the Darkness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At least.
 This time...
 glimmers of light finally shine through that long and dark night.
 Over the generations, we have created so many wonders.
 We had solved so many of our problems.
 The internet now connects those of the Light together in a way they had
 never had before.
 Medicine lessens so many of the pointless tragedies of the past.
 And so much more...

You dream of a better world, and you know how you could help the world get
 there.
 But it's still not easy.
 A Luminous can defeat the monster, she can win the election and start instituti

 But in the end, a single person can still only do so much even with magic.
 The dream of the Luminous can only be achieved together, when a hundred
 million small victories add up.
 It isn't easy.
 It is a struggle.
 But it is worth it in the end.

Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different story from the popular original, Magia Record’s focus pivoted
 more to the human response to the woes of magic in a dark world.
 It focuses on relationships, girls pulling each other from the brink of
 despair, and standing up for what’s right.
 With many side-stories in the original phone game, it showcased slice-of-life
 episodes that brought attention to the bonds needed to survive being a
 magical girl.

While more seinen than most conventional magical girl shows, Symphogear
 is underlined with themes of heartfelt communication between people who
 otherwise misunderstand each other, determination to protect, and what
 we sacrifice in order to protect.
 The main character, Hibiki, embodies much of what the Luminous stand for,
 with her belief in the ability to reach to the heart, and the refusal to
 give up in the heart of darkness, whether it be in actual battle or peoples
 own despair.
 Each member of the main cast suffers tragedy, and it’s through their bonds
 with others that they’re able to stand up again.

The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part

Whereas the first movie focused on creativity and freedom, the second discusses

 It shows that growing up doesn’t mean that the things you believed in when
 younger have to be forgotten and let go of.
 It tells of how even in a darker world, hoping is not in vain.
 The movie shows the world like the Luminous see it; almost everyone else
 loses their flame, their light, their hope in the world, because they believe
 it’s the only way to survive.
 But it isn't true.
 The song Everything’s Not Awesome summarizes it all fairly well.

The Luminous built the Dream they draw their Light from over the generations,
 hiding it away in the corners of humanity's shared subconscious.
 Their Light is as fluid and shifting a thing as any other dream.
 Before the Luminous were magical girls, they were the paladins in shining
 armor, the angels with wings of light, the witch in the forest, the village
 shaman.
 All dreaming of a better world, where they and those they love could simply
 live happily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the moment they Blossom, the nascent Hopeful awakens to that shared Dream,
 using its symbols and ideas to build herself a new form and construct your
 ideal identity.
 In that moment, she makes a shard of the Light truly her own power.

Each Hopeful's Light is woven out of three symbols, drawn from the Dream:

The Dream the Luminous visit in their sleep and draw their power from is
 itself a true world, if one built out of stories and feelings rather than
 the matter and physics of the real world.
 In that world of dreams, they built eight Kingdoms of Light over the years,
 dream-like visions of what the world could be some day in the future.
 Those visions shape the Invocations the Nobles use to shape their magic,
 written by like-minded Luminous over the generations all preserved in the
 light of the Dream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kingdom is not quite like the Luminary or Archetype of a Luminous.
 Rather than being a part of their Dreamscape, it is rather the physical
 location their Dreamscape resides in.
 Whether its Threshold appears as a mansion in a major city or an out-of-the-way
 hollow in an unsuspecting tree, its physical presence in the Kingdom itself
 is what defines a Noble unambiguously as a member of it.
\end_layout

Ildathach, the Domain of Colors

 Its Invocation is Prisma, of uncompromising idealism and defiance against
 what must be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Character Creation|textbf

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step One: Character Concept 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin creating a Luminous, come up with a rough idea of who you want
 to play.
 What kind of upbringing did she have? What kind of experiences, good or
 bad, did she have growing up? What does she think of the world around her?
 What does she want to see the world become? What has she experienced to
 lead her to want to change the world? What led up to her Blossoming, if
 it happened before the game starts?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't worry too much about details like Invocations yet.
 Instead, try to figure out who your character is inside, how they think
 and feel, and who they see themselves as.
 From that, distill it into a simple core concept like "young politician"
 or "aspiring writer".
 As you go through the character creation process, you can always fall back
 on this initial seed and do whatever feels right given it or adjust it
 if you think something else would fit her just a slight bit better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Aspirations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, choose your character's Aspirations.
 Hopeful have two more aspirations than usual, for a total of five.
 Two of them must be related to the supernatural world, or her Dream Form.
 What does she want to do to make the world a better place? What supernatural
 creatures has she run into before, and what does she like to do with them?
 Has she run into any supernatural problems she wants to solve?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, two of her aspirations must relate to her mundane life, or
 at least the mundane world.
 Does she have friends she made a promise to? Does she have an internet
 community to run? What is her school life like, and is there something
 she would especially like to accomplish there?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of your Aspirations should be short term goals that can be completed
 in a session or two, and at least one should be a longer-term goal that
 may take a whole Chapter to complete.
 Aspirations are one of the main ways you earn beats, which advance your
 character.
 They help the Storyteller know where you want to go with your character,
 and what kinds of stories you want them to experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Two: Select Attributes 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transformed Attributes
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Attributes are the innate characteristics of your character, such as how
 fast, charismatic or smart she is.
 When choosing your attributes, ask yourself what would lead your character
 to lead to her living the life she does, what she would choose to develop,
 what skills she relies on, and whether she uses her magic or mundane skills
 to achieve her goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous and characters who are intended to Blossom in play do not choose
 their attributes like most characters.
 Begin by choosing her three transformed attributes (p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec-TransformedAttrs"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Begin with 1 dot in each transformed attribute, then assign 8 dots between
 her transformed attributes, up to a maximum of 6 dots in any attribute.
 Then, beginning with 1 dot in each mundane attribute, distribute 12 dots
 between your character's mundane attributes up to a maximum of 5 dots in
 any attribute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None of your character's mundane attributes may exceed their corresponding
 transformed attribute and you may not assign more than 5 dots to each of
 the mundane attribute categories (Physical, Mental and Social).
 If the highest mundane attribute corresponding to a transformed attribute
 is lower than the amount you assigned earlier, gain the remainder as transforme
d attribute dots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Three: Select Skills 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transformed Skills
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Next, choose your character's Skills.
 They reflect the more specific skills she has gained over her life rather
 than her innate traits.
 When choosing Skills, think about your character's background.
 What had she studied during school? What are her hobbies?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assign her skills using the same process as her attributes, except skills
 begin at 0 dots instead of 1 dot.
 Assign 15 dots between her transformed skills (p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec-TransformedSkills"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), then assign 22 dots between her mundane skills.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with attributes, none of your character's mundane skills may exceed the
 corresponding transformed skill, and you may not assign more than 11 dots
 to any of the mundane skill categories.
 If the highest transformed skill corresponding to a transformed skill is
 lower than the amount you assigned earlier, again gain the remainder as
 transformed dots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Four: Skill Specialties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You start with three Skill Specialties, representing your character's particular
 field of competence in a given skill, as opposed to the broader competence
 Skill dots represent.
 You write your own Skill Specialties, reflecting where your character truly
 shines in their broader field.
 For example, a character may have specialty in Poetry for the Expression
 skill.
 As usual, this is a chance to refine your idea of who your character is,
 as much as a chance to express it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step Five: Add Luminous Template 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, you're ready to deal with the more magical aspects of your
 character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Luminary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When she Blossoms, a Luminous builds her Dream Form from the symbols of
 the Dream.
 The first of these is her Luminary (p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec-Luminary"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), the celestial light she patterns her magic after.
 It forms the basis of how she uses her magic, and decides which of the
 three powers of the Luminous she focuses on.
 Read over the three Luminaries you may pick (Sunlight, Moonlight and Starlight)
, and choose the one that fits your character concept the best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Archetype 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether your character would be a shining hero, an idol whose songs change
 the world, or a shrine maiden that upholds the boundary between worlds,
 she is yet still a Luminous.
 The Luminous have taken on many forms and roles over their long history,
 after all.
 Her Archetype reflects which of those legacies she would wish to continue
 on, and the overall form and concept of her Dream Form.
 Read over the Archetypes (p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec-Archetype"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), and choose one that your character would wish to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Kingdom 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Dream, the Luminous built eight great Kingdoms (p.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "Sec-Kingdoms"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), reflecting the world as they saw it could be in the distant future.
 They draw power from their Kingdoms, invoking the principles and feelings
 that underlie them through their Invocations.
 Read over the Kingdoms and choose the one that your character would most
 believe in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Dream & Will
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose your character's Dream and Will.
 While most mortals have a Virtue and a Vice, Luminous draw their strength
 from their dearest dreams and shining will.
 Her Dream is the ideal world she would wish to live in, far in the distant
 future.
 It is the hope she clings to when she needs reminding what she is fighting
 for, and the world she dreams of in her sleep.
 Her Will is the means by which she changes the world, and interacts with
 it.
 It is the part of herself she draws on to face the challenges the world
 bring against her, how she connects with a world that seems far too foreign
 to her.

 When a Luminous Blossoms, the first part of the world she changes is herself.
 In her nascent Dreamscape, she weaves an image of her world into her very
 soul.
 While she doesn't truly lose her mortal Virtues and Vices, they no longer
 anchor her well enough against her own dreams, nor the world's pressures.
 Rather, she learns to draw on that image of a better world, and the means
 by which she knows she can touch the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Her vision of her ideal world is called her Dream.
 It is the one possible future out of endless possibilities that she considers
 truly her own, one she could comfortably live in for herself and those
 she loves.
 A Hopeful who Dreams of "Among the Stars" may draw on the magic of Dannan,
 but that world is ultimately a kind of compromise.
 Unfettered by such things, they would dream of a world where all have a
 place among the countless stars, each planet holding its own form of utopia.
 When a Luminous takes a risk to make their Dream a reality, she regains
 one Willpower.
 When a Luminous makes noticeable progress in realizing that Dream for herself
 or the broader world, she regains all Willpower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The means by which she knows she can change the world is called her Will.
 Even if she has many talents, it is the one she holds closest to her heart,
 the thing she falls back on when everything else fails.
 A Dreamer who writes for a newspaper in her waking life may have a Will
 of a

, while one who supports her family and friends may have a Will of 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

Counceler
\begin_inset Quotes xrd

 Whenever a Luminous overcomes a challenge in affirming her Will, she regains
 one Willpower.
 Whenever a Luminous takes a significant risk in the process, she regains
 all Willpower.

The Hopeful draw on the external world, as much as they rely on their inner
 strength.
 Nobody can just fight their whole life without...
 something breaking inside.
 Not alone, not without something to hold themselves steady.
 A Touchstone is something or someone tangible that gives the Luminous emotional
 strength, and reminds her that there is good in the world even now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, those remainders are the people she have helped in life and now
 walk by her side.
 Sometimes, it's her family of choice and close friends who once rescued
 her from her own darkest times.
 Sometimes, it is the beautiful gardens that remind her of the wonder the
 world has always had.
 Whatever form it takes, a Luminous' Touchstones are the things the Luminous
 can draw on for emotional strength even in the darkest times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, their Touchstones represent vulnerabilities in her life as much
 as they are a source of strength.
 When a Luminous permanently loses one of her Touchstones, she takes a five-dice
 severe Hope attack.
 Whenever a Luminous acts to defend one of her Touchstones, she regains
 a Willpower point.
 If this defense causes her serious harm, she regains all her spent Willpower
 points.
 
\end_layout

Luminous begin with a single Touchstone, and may gain more by buying the
 Touchstone merit.
 Note that most Luminous also have their Nakama to serve as a second Touchstone.

 of will.

The Luminous learn to draw the Dream into reality, suspending the laws of
 the waking world just long enough to make a difference.
 Still, there is always a disconnect between what they can dream, and what
 they can actually do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous' Reverie measures how strongly she may connect the waking world
 and the Dream.
 As it increases, she is able to have higher traits in Dream Form, maintain
 more Regalia at once, spend more Motes without cost each turn, and deepens
 her natural empathic abilities.
 However...
 it doesn't come without downsides.
 As her power grows she also acclimates to the ways of the Dream.
 For powerful Luminous, adjusting back to their Mundane Form becomes increasingl
y difficult.

Motes are the small shards of the Dream's power that a Hopeful draws on
 to fuel her magic.
 She does not need to gather it from an outside source, but rather simply
 draws them from deep within her soup.
 A Luminous may simply spend a certain number of Motes equal to her Mote
 Capacity safely each turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond that, she must draw deeper on her being, converting a small fragment
 of her own emotions and dreams to fuel the rest of that magic and leaving
 her feeling down and worn out until she has had the time to recover.
 When her Mote Capacity is exhausted, she may still intentionally take a
 box of mild Hope damage to spend an additional Mote for the turn.
 Should she have no remaining undamaged Hope boxes, she may take a box of
 severe Hope damage instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike most types of supernatural creatures, a Princess cannot spend the
 Motes to use her powers over multiple turns.
 If a power costs more Motes than her Mote Capacity, she must spend it all
 in one turn and take the resulting Hope damage.

The ideals of each of the Dream Kingdoms resonate throughout the Dream,
 and Weavers draw on those Invocations to shape their own magics.
 Learning an Invocation allows a Luminous to draw on the pooled knowledge
 and magical skills that like-minded Luminous left behind generations ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous may have up to 5 dots in each Invocation.
 Each Kingdom favors one Invocation, and the Luminous find the Invocation
 of their home Kingdom the easiest to learn.
 Due to this tie with the Dream Kingdoms that embody their beliefs, the
 Invocations are described under the Kingdom that they originate in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These Invocations reflect a worldview as much a source of power.
 While a Luminous can use the power of Kingdoms she does not agree with,
 she does grasp their logic and concepts intuitively and cannot draw on
 the Dream directly to learn them.
 As a guideline, a Luminous who agrees with one or two of an Invocation's
 Beliefs may intuitively learn three dots of it alone.
 One who agrees with all of them in at least vague terms may learn five
 dots of it alone.
 Otherwise, she must be taught the Invocation by someone who already understands
 its principles better.

 Luminous magic is roughly divided into three major categories: Regalia,
 Domains and Charms.
\end_layout

The Regalia are the most physical embodiments of a Luminous' power.
 They are the radiant auras and weapons she summons in their Dream Form
 to fight or solve the kinds of problems that require a more direct approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Hopeful's Domains are the elements and concepts that resonate with her
 Invocations and her own dream.
 They are the power that defines the Luminous as fundamentally magical in
 the way they so often seem to be, allowing them to wield the elements as
 naturally as they move their own body.

Far too often, Luminous find themselves wanting to change the world when
 they personally experience the cruelties of the world.
 They cannot help but feel the pains of those around them, and even if they
 escape the worst of it personally, they almost certainly grow close to
 someone who suffers from it for one reason or another.
 They are themselves hurt by a world that tells them they are naive to hope,
 and a thousand times again when they see the pain reflected in another.

As much as the pains of others hurt them too, the Luminous can at least

 The level of connection they can have makes it easier for them to comfort

 Sensitivity provides the following bonuses:

\begin_layout Itemize
You add your Sensitivity as a bonus to mundane Empathy or any Resonate rolls

 feels, even as she does her best to help those around her.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever a Hopeful witnesses or learns about a situation that caused someone
 significant emotional pain, she takes a mild Hope attack with dice equal
 to her Sensitivity.
 Deliberate acts of cruelty add a dice to this attack, and particularly
 heinous acts (such as prolonged deliberate torture) may add up to three
 dice or instead cause severe Hope damage.
\end_layout

Afterwards, she may immediately replace a short-term aspiration with one

 When she completes such an Aspiration, she gains an additional beat and
 recovers all mild Hope damage.
 Luminous may have no more than two aspirations from Sensitivity at once.

 When a Luminous first Blossoms, she becomes the dreams and wonders she
 always knew as a child.
 She reclaims the emotion and imagination that she once knew, feeling her
 triumphs and struggles as strongly as she did the first time she truly
 opened her eyes to the world.
 The challenges of life and the shadows of the world around her hurt her

 But...
 she can always turn to the wonders remaining in the world.

Luminous have Hope instead of Integrity, a measurement of her emotional
 well being and will to fight.
 When her Hope is damaged, she feels down and drained, and the conviction

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous have a Hope track equal to their transformed Power + Resistance
 that behaves similarly to a health track.
 When an ability refers to a character's Hope, it means the number of undamaged
 Hope boxes she possesses.
 Luminous are considered to have an Integrity equivalent equal to 5 + her
 undamaged Hope boxes (to a maximum of 10).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Hope Damage and Recovery 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events that shake a Hopeful's resolve or strain her emotions cause her to
 suffer an attack against her Hope.
 She may take two kinds of Hope damage as a result.
 Mild Hope damage represents simpler emotional strain from her overexerting
 her magic or simply the weight of life bearing down on her without a release.
 Severe Hope damage represents fundamentally deeper pains that linger, even
 when the situation clears up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each time a Luminous takes Hope damage, mark it off her Hope track using
 a slash (/) for mild damage and an (X) for severe damage.
 Mark mild damage in the leftmost empty box of her Hope track, and severe
 damage in the leftmost empty box or the leftmost box that is marked with
 only mild damage.
 Whenever a Princess takes mild Hope damage when her rightmost Hope box
 is filled, she instead takes a point of severe Hope damage.

When something shakes a Princess' resolve or emotional stability, they take

 The Luminous takes a number of the stated severity of Hope damage equal

 Non-contested rolls against her suffer a penalty equal to her Hope, even

 The two people are very close to each other, often sharing much of their

 This often applies to those such as typical married couples, very close
 friends, parents and their children, or family of choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Medium:
\series default
 The two people are on friendly terms with each other and come to know each
 other on deeper terms.
 This often applies to those such as good friends, confidants, siblings,
 or a typical dating couple.
 Weak: The two people have met each other before, and interact on occasion
 but rarely in particular depth.
 This often applies to those such as coworkers, gaming partners, extended
 family, or a friend of a friend.
 Hostile or unfriendly relationships also fall under this category, though
 some kinds of ambiguous relationships (such as a passionate rivalry) can
 justify stronger Intimacy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Described:
\series default
 You have a basic idea of who the person is, but have not interacted directly
 in any significant manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These bonds must be mutual and cannot be strained by formal contexts or
 ingenious premises.
 If two people have different feelings towards each other, the lower Intimacy
 implied holds.
 For example, a therapist and her patient often only have Weak Intimacy,
 despite how much of her patient's life she learns, as they only interact
 in formal contexts, and are effectively forbidden from having a relationship
 beyond a very formal and professional one.
 Similarly, unrequited love from a stalker rarely produces more than Weak
 Intimacy unless reciprocated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, Intimacy is used as a penalty to the dice pool of abilities.
 When it is used in this way, Connected Intimacy provides no penalty, Strong
 Intimacy inflicts a -2 penalty, Medium intimacy provides a -4 penalty,
 Weak Intimacy inflicts a -8 penalty, and Described Intimacy inflicts a
 -12 penalty.
 When using such an ability, you may use the Intimacy of a person you are
 touching, at the cost of decreasing the Intimacy by one level.

Luminous are innately aware of the general feeling and mood of any location

Luminous and those with Medium Intimacy dream of each other in vague terms,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lesser degrees of Intimacy are not strong enough to have any effect.

\begin_layout Standard
This effect applies separately to a Hopeful's Mundane and Dream forms, and
 these dreams do not penetrate the protection of Dual Identity at Strong

 Once per scene, either may spend a Willpower to reflect a Virtue, Dream,
 Wish or similar Anchor of someone they have Strong or closer Intimacy with
 until the scene ends.
 This grants 9-Again for all actions that follow that Anchor.
 In addition, Luminous gain the Anchor for all purposes including Willpower
 recovery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Flaring an Echo 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous may flare her Echo as an instant action at any time, or as an
 reflexive action while transforming by spending two Willpower.
 She focuses on the emotion and meanings underlying her Dream, and projects
 it forth through her Echo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An Echo intensified in this way conveys her Dream and inner truths to everyone
 who sees her, not only those with preexisting ties to her.
 She rolls Reverie + Hope.
 If she succeeds, she inflicts the Echo Flare tilt on everyone within the
 general vicinity, granting them 9-again on all actions that align with
 her Dream and causing actions antithetical to her Dream to lose 10-again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Someone affected by Echo Flare may shake it off by spending a Willpower
 reflexively and rolling Composure + Resolve.
 If she gains an equal number or more successes than the Luminous' roll,
 she loses the tilt.
 The tilt otherwise naturally ends at the scene's end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luminous may contest an Echo Flare with her own Echo, contesting it with
 Reverie + Hope.
 If she wins, she is not affected by the aura, and instead inflicts her
 own Echo Flare against the other Luminous.
 Many other types of supernatural beings have innate auras that inflict
 Conditions or Tilts.
 Luminous may contest their active flares with her Echo as well, in the
 same way as Echos.

\begin_layout Subsection
Transformed Traits 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to their different set of attributes and skills, Luminous use different
 traits in their Dream Form and Mundane Form.
 In her dream form, she calculates derived attributes as such:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Luminous' Dream Form always has a default Size of 5, regardless of her
 natural size.
 They have separate Form Merits that may be used to change this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maximum Willpower is calculated as Resistance + Finesse.
 Unlike with most of these traits, this total is used for her mundane form
 as well as her Dream Form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Defense is equal to the lower of her Resistance and Finesse + Flow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initiative is equal to Finesse + Resistance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Speed is equal to Power + Finesse + 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Form-Locked Dots 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Luminous may buy dots in her transformed attributes or skills directly,
 instead of increasing the corresponding mundane traits.
 Furthermore, she may buy dots in merits that only apply to one of her forms.
 Refund one beat for each experience spent on such a form-locked merit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Add your character's transformed attribute and skill dots to the normal
 base ranking derived from her mundane skills.
 As a Luminous' mundane attribute cap never increases, such dots are the
 only way for her to gain attributes and skills above 5 dots.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dual Identity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Transformation!Dual Identity|(textbf
\end_layout

\end_inset

The Hopeful derive one last benefit from their transformation: Their mundane
 and dream forms appear to be two different people.
 Regardless of how similar her two forms look, others around her treat them
 as if they had entirely different appearances.
 This is not exactly an illusion, as it does not change what people see.
 Rather, it simply prevents them from recognizing the two forms as the same
 based on such.
 This protection extends to magical senses such as a Vampire's taste for
 blood, or an Uratha's ability to track others by scent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supernatural powers used to try and link her two identities are similarly
 fooled.
 Powers that use Sympathy or Intimacy treat her two forms as separate --
 a friend who only knows her in her mundane form has no Sympathy with her
 Dream Form.
 Powers that determine information about a Luminous do not directly reveal
 information that connect her two identities, treating her (at best) as
 two people with close ties to the same friend group.
 That may still break her cover in the context of a full investigation,
 of course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As powerful as it is, however, a Luminous cannot rely solely on Dual Identity
 to protect herself.
 It does not prevent others from suspecting a Luminou' nature based on circumsta
ntial evidence.
 She cannot simply dip into a closet only to return as a mysterious magical
 girl, and not expect others to not draw the connection.
 She obviously cannot transform in front of someone, and expect Dual Identity
 to protect her even slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cases where she needs to intentionally prove her identity, she may spend
 a Willpower to drop this protection for the rest of a scene.
 This does not necessarily convince others that she is the same person if
 she looks radically different in her two forms, but it at least removes
 any supernatural components of her disguise.

Flicker

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Flicker|(textbf
\end_layout

\end_inset

The Hopeful balance on a precipice between dreams and reality, one where
 it is all too easy to slip.
 In their Dream Form they are empowered to touch the world in terms of stories
 and intents, rather than physics and forces.
 For the Luminous, it is too easy to get used to half-dreaming like that.
 When a Luminous reverts to Mundane Form, she suffers Flicker as she readjusts
 her mundane body.
 At Reverie 1-2, Flicker lasts for 10 minutes.
 At Reverie 3-5, Flicker ends after 1 scene or 1 hour, whichever comes earlier.
 At Reverie 6-8, Flicker ends after 4 scenes or 4 hours, whichever comes
 earlier.
 At Reverie 9-10, Flicker ends after a day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When suffering from Flicker, a Luminous is ever so slightly distracted by
 the dreams and imaginations that would fuel her magic if she were in Dream
 Form, and ever so slightly clumsy as they fail to have the power she, on
 some level, expects.
 She suffers a penalty equal to her Reverie divided by 3 (rounded up) to
 all actions taken in her Mundane Form.
 Once per scene, if she fails an important roll or suffers social complications
 due to this, she gains a Beat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At Reverie 6 and above, Flicker no longer requires a Luminous to intentionally
 transform into Dream Form.
 Even mundane dreams and visits to the Dream are enough to cause Flicker
 when she wakes up.
